I made all kinds of music during my studies, but I wanted to summarize everything I learned in a special good music project, which would also be in Finnish. I wanted to show my skills to the local audience. None of my previous projects fit the Finnish format, so I created a new one. This idea was born at the same time when I discovered the \"live music\" attribute in the Suno artificial intelligence, which made the music sound like a live concert where the audience claps and sings along. I immediately noticed that the AI ​​somehow created better songs with this \"live music\" attribute, and I wanted to try making a 4-song album like this."
