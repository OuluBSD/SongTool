			"value": "1. What Steve Packard (born 2013, likes Pop-Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n-I don't want to fight and I don't want to break up. That's not how relationships should be. It seems like it's too late to repair the damage done, but if the damage caused by us still hurts one another, then things have to change for the better.\n\n2. What Mila Smith (born 2009, likes KoreaPop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- It's really sad to hear that one of them is always hurting the other in the end. Relationships don't have to end this way. There is always hope and something to work for. We just have to be positive and put in the effort.\n\n3. What Paul Lee (born 2003, likes Rap) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- Sounds like someone is stuck in a cycle of pain and dissatisfaction. It's understandable that they want to try to make things work but it's important to make sure both sides are equally invested in the relationship. That way, both can benefit from it. \n\n4. What Tina Smith (born 1996, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- This is really heartbreaking. It's hard to maintain a relationship when one of you is always doing something to hurt the other. Relationships should be built on trust and understanding, not pain and disappointment.\n\n5. What Bobby Reynolds (born 1995, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- It sounds like the couple in the song have been through a lot and they are struggling to find the balance between being together and going their separate ways. It's hard to make a relationship work but if you both believe in it, it can definitely be done. \n\n6. What Rachel Johnson (born 1992, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- This is a tough situation to be in. It's hard to find the balance between staying in a relationship and leaving it. Both participants have to be willing to put in the effort for it to work. It's about having patience and understanding.\n\n7. What Shawn Johnson (born 1991, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- You have to want to stay together. If it isn't worth the effort anymore, then it's time to move on. Relationships should be healthy and both partners should be willing to make it work. No one should be hurting each other in the process.\n\n8. What Jake White (born 1989, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- It saddens me to hear that even when they love each other, there always seems to be hurt in the end. Relationships should bring joy and happiness, not more heartache. People should strive to bring positive energy into a relationship.\n\n9. What Cyrus McCall (born 1988, likes Rap) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- It sounds like the couple in the song is stuck in an endless cycle of love and pain. It's hard to repair a relationship when one of you is always hurting the other. It's important to put in the effort to make the relationship work as best as you can. \n\n10. What Kelly Taylor (born 1987, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- This is a really difficult situation to be in. Love can be so complicated and can hurt so much. It's important to be honest with yourself and the other person in order to make a relationship work.\n\n11. What Mike Richards (born 1977, likes Metal) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:\n- It's heartbreaking to see someone in such a delicate and painful situation. Relationships don't have to end up this way. It takes courage to hope for and stay in a relationship, and both parties have to be willing to work together and repair the hurts."
