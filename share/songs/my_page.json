			"value": "1. What Mila Smith (born 2009, likes KoreaPop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- Wow, this cool! It has a magical vibe to it with all this talk of fairies, witches, and potions. It reminds me of the K-Pop songs I love. I'm not so sure about the idea of wishing for someone to \"start loving me,\" though. That kind of seems a little awkward and desperate.\n\n2. What Paul Lee (born 2003, likes Rap) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- I don't really get the whole fantasy element of this song. It doesn't seem very rap-like to me. Plus, I'm not sure about the whole Abracadabra thing - that sounds a little childish and silly.\n\n3. What Tina Smith (born 1996, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- I really like the retro sound of this song and the almost mystical feel. It's got a classic pop vibe that I'm definitely into. I'm not sure about the mention of the witch, though. That kind of thing isn't really my thing.\n\n4. What Bobby Reynolds (born 1995, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This isn't really my type of music - it feels a bit too soft and poppy for me. I don't like the witch and wizard references either - it kind of takes away from the rock edge of the song.\n\n5. What Rachel Johnson (born 1992, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This is a really nice sing-along kind of song - it's got a cheerful tune and easy to remember lyrics. I'm not sure about the fantasy references, though. I can kind of get behind it, but it feels a bit too abstract for me.\n\n6. What Shawn Johnson (born 1991, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This song is alright, but it's not really my type of music. I'm all about hard rock, not fluffy pop-facts. And this one is a bit too light for my tastes - and the lyrics about a witch and a crystal ball are a bit too cheesy for me.\n\n7. What Jake White (born 1989, likes Pop) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This is really catchy and it has a magical feel to it. I love the way the lyrics mix fantasy with reality. I'm not sure about the parts where it talks about wishing for someone to \"start loving me,\" though. That seems a bit desperate.\n\n8. What Cyrus McCall (born 1988, likes Rap) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This is a neat song, but it's not really my style. I don't really get the fantasy stuff. Plus, I'm not sure about the whole Abracadabra thing - that sounds a bit childish and silly.\n\n9. What Kelly Taylor (born 1987, likes Rock) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- I like the energy that this song has, but I'm not sure about the witchy stuff. It kind of takes away from the rock edge of the song. And I'm not sure about the part where it talks about wishing for someone to \"start loving me\" - that seems kind of desperate.\n\n10. What Mike Richards (born 1977, likes Metal) would think while hearing the song with these lyrics. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in lyrics only:\n- This song is alright, but it's not really my type of music. I'm all about heavy metal, not fluffy pop fantasy. And this one is a bit too light for my tastes - and the lyrics about a witch and a crystal ball are a bit too cheesy for me."
