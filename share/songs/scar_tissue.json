			"value": "1. What Mila Smith (born 2009, likes KoreaPop) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-The initial reactions would be awe and excitement at how the video depicts the band and its members. There is a lot of creativity in the way the shots are displayed, and the music video as a whole looks visually stunning. She would appreciate how diverse the range of music is, and appreciate the mix of rock and pop elements. She would also find the combination of desert landscape and the band setting quite unique and captivating. However, she might think that the slightly darker atmosphere of the storyline and images could be a bit overbearing at times and the video could benefit from some lightheartedness. \n\n2. What Paul Lee (born 2003, likes Rap) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Paul would be drawn in by the visuals of the video, such as the desert setting and the progressive camera work. He might also appreciate the variety of music, enjoying either the rock or rap influenced elements. However, he may find the video too slow-paced and mellow in contrast to his fast-paced rap preference. He may also find the lack of a more substantial storyline slightly underwhelming. \n\n3. What Tina Smith (born 1996, likes Pop) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Tina would find the visuals of the music video quite captivating, especially the various colors of the desert landscape and the subtle details displayed in the images. She would likely enjoy the pop elements of the music, and appreciate the combination of slower paced verses with vibrant choruses. However, she may find some of the lyrics too heavy and dark and feel like they detract from musicality of the song. \n\n4. What Bobby Reynolds (born 1995, likes Rock) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Bobby would find the visuals of the music video quite captivating, especially the subtle details of the car interior and the use of colors in the desert landscape. He would appreciate the heavier rock elements of the song as its more in line with his musical preferences. However, he might find the combination of genres too overwhelming at times and also think that the variety of landscapes could detract from the storyline instead of reinforcing it. \n\n5. What Rachel Johnson (born 1992, likes Pop) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Rachel would appreciate the intricate details of the visuals and the unique combination of landscapes. She would particularly appreciate the pops of vibrant color which break up the darker imagery. She would also enjoy the smooth transition between the different genres of music, and appreciate the way the choruses add to the dynamic of the song. However, she may think the video lacks drama and could benefit from some greater depth in the lyrics. \n\n6. What Shawn Johnson (born 1991, likes Rock) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Shawn would appreciate the diverse range of music and the unique blend of genres. He would be drawn in by the visuals of the desert landscapes and be filled with energy when the rock elements of the music kick in. However, he may find the storyline a little too cliche and simplistic and think that it could benefit from a more engaging narrative.\n\n7. What Jake White (born 1989, likes Pop) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Jake would be impressed by the visuals of the video, and particularly appreciate the way the camera switches between angles and distances. He would enjoy the pop elements of the music, and appreciate the way the choruses are layered over the verses. However, he may find some of the scenes uneventful and think that the video would benefit from more exciting visuals during these sections. \n\n8. What Cyrus McCall (born 1988, likes Rap) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Cyrus would appreciate the unique combination of different musical elements, and particularly the way that rap elements are married to slower-paced rock elements. He would enjoy the visuals of the desert landscapes, and appreciate the intimacy of the camera shots inside the car and out in the desert. However, he may find the video too mellow and lacking in energy at times, particularly in comparison to his usual rap-centric musical preferences. \n\n9. What Kelly Taylor (born 1987, likes Rock) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Kelly would appreciate the visuals of the music video, in particular the variety of landscapes and the occasional flashes of vibrant colour. She would enjoy the rock elements of the song, and appreciate the way the instrumentation combines with the vocals to create a powerful and energetic sound. However, she may find the pacing of the video too slow and think that the intense visuals could be used more to generate tension and suspense.\n\n10. What Mike Richards (born 1977, likes Metal) would think while seeing the music video with this screenplay. Initial reaction and critically important and negative things in screenplay only:\n-Mike would appreciate the visuals of the music video, and particularly the unique desert landscapes and the detailed shots of the cars interior. He would enjoy the metal elements of the song, and appreciate the way the instrumentation has been used to create an intense atmosphere. However, he may find the combination of genres too melodramatic and think that the video would benefit from a faster pace and heavier sound."

It's so cool to have a car drive across the desert and there's even a tattooed arm! The production value looks great, and the imagery of the scenes is beautiful.

This track's musicianship and writing bring out the manliness, humour, and resilience of the artist's white caucasian male perspective. The instrumentation is strong and rhythmic with a driving beat that reiterates the main themes and lyrics throughout the song. There's a catchy chorus with a contagious melody that will easily stay in the listener's head well after the song has finished."
