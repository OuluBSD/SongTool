		"references": "The song includes references to various ideas and concepts from cultures around the world.

Additionally, the idea of raising one's hand to be noticed as a sign of strength and independence is a cultural concept found in many contexts, from schools to the work place. The line \"Think about why you're not the first in line yet\" references the idea of strive for success and achievement which is common in many cultures.\r\n",
		"structure": "The song has an upbeat and uplifting feel with a fast-paced rhythm. The melody is comprised of major chords, giving the song an emotive yet optimistic feel. The prominent percussion elements and the higher register of the instruments contribute to the dynamic and powerful sound of the chorus.

The song ultimately conveys a message of self-empowerment and encourages the listener to stand up for themselves and never settle for less than they deserve.\r\n",
		"implications": "The song has an underlying message of individualism and personal empowerment which can have several social and political implications. By encouraging people to embrace their uniqueness and find strength in themselves rather than conforming to societal expectations, the song can be interpreted as a call to break away from traditional powers and to push for greater representation of marginalized voices. It can be seen as an advocacy for those who are struggling against oppression or inequality, and can provide hope and motivation to those who are searching for the courage to speak up.\r\n"
