	"biography": "Kai Marie is a Caucasian woman born in 1963 who comes from Oulu, Finland. She has been going to dances since she was young, where she has liked all kinds of dance music, but especially couple dance music and disco dance from the 70s and 80s. Swinging Dixieland jazz has also been to his liking. Calm stripped-down ballads are also good in his opinion. She has dabbled in folk dancing and her husband has been her dance partner. As a music listener, music means cheerfulness, overcoming sorrows, getting going, relaxation. As a singer, the audience means a lot to her. Performing for an audience is interaction for her, and she likes it when the audience listens or even dances. She remains calm in many situations where others get nervous. She maintains rational thinking in a stressful situation.",
