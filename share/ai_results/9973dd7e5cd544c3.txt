Jump cut, the natural look, an echo of a mister 
Know-it-all, in a moody scar tissue 
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, with the birds I'm sharing a lonely view 
Nodding my head, I'm smiling, with you I'm kissing the birds to share a rich viewin, 
The soothing color tint, dynamic with the birds I'm sharing
