A southern girl is standing in the stall 
With rich red blood that's starting to crawl 
She's got her head cocked to the side 
And her mouth agape as she says her goodbye

Bright and bold with a glowing allure,
She swaggers out to the outside with the birds
Ma and Pa grasp for a wave goodbye 
With the lonely view they share in the sky.
