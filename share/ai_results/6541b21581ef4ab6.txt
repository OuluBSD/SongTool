Step outside and I'll take my chances 
Taste my health since I'm a man of leisure
Vibrant colors in a moody sky, flashing rhythm to my heart's beat
Wide eyes swaying to the sound, have to crawl to make it to the moon
Raising eyebrows as I set off, bouncing to the music as I go
To make it to the moon, a magical, contrasting world.
