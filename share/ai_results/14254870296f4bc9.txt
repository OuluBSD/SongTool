Southern girl with a rich and bold look 
In an unknown location, in an unspecifed time of day
Swaying her head to side, crouching low
With the birds she'll wave goodbye, her mouth agape
The bright outside with a glowing viewin 
Watching the birds share a lonely view, dynamic and neat
With ma and pa, she'll softly drawl as she blood loss in her stall
