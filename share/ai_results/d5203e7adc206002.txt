Scar tissue that I wish you saw, (you) Sarcastic mister know-it-all.
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, 'cause with the birds I'll share (lonely view).

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

verse2
Push me up against the wall, (you) Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra.
Fallin' all over myself to lick your heart and taste your health ('cause)

chorus2
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall, (with) a southern girl with a scarlet drawl (way to speak).
I wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause with the birds I'll share (this lonely view)

verse4
(I'm) soft spoken with a broken jaw, (but I still) step outside, but not to brawl.
And autumn's sweet, we call it fall.
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl (and)
