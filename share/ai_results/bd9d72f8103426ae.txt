She's a Southern girl with an unknown place 
Squinting her eyes under the bold face
Swaying her head to the side, while the blood loss takes its place
She waves goodbye with the birds, sharing a lonely view with ma and pa
The sky is bright, and a rich color
The birds are dynamic, and mouth agape
With the glowing bathroom stall to her side and the southern drawl of goodbye 
The free spirit is sharing the view with a wave.
