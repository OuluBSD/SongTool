Falling in, lick your health
Taste your bold and gritty soul
Against a wall, in a room, I whisper
Lick your heart, fill you up
Raise my eyebrows, gesture with my arms
To a vibrant, Kentucky girl, a refined shock
Blur and flash, wish you well
Dramatic 'do, purse my lips, shrug my shoulders
Lonely view of a free spirited individual who is optimistic, playful and joyful, yet realistic and accepting of imperfection
