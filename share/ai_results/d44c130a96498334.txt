Southern girl, in an unknown town
With the bold makeup and her squinting eyes
Watching her blood, see her southern drawl
Swaying her head to and fro, she waves goodbye
The birds, bright, crouching outside
Share the lonely view with ma and pa 
Rich in color, a dynamic goodbye 
With those glowing neut eyes, she mouths agape
