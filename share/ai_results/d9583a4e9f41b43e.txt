Southern girl with bold hair and squinting eyes
Swaying head side to side in the present allure
Glowing bathroom stall and a river of blood, with her southern drawl
With the birds I wave goodbye, rich colors and a lonely view
Sharing the outside with ma and pa, a dynamic crouch and neat style
I share my mouth agape, wishing her an optimistic goodbye.
