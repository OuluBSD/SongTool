Echoing in my head, in a jump cut to your face
A natural mister, so scar tissue tells a moody dress
Sarcastic mister know-it-all, crossing his arms in the present
With a frown that's stark, so I close my eyes and kiss you
The birds they share a lonely view, nodding my head with a smile
Smooth and stylish, we share such rich moments
'Cause with the birds, I'll share in the viewin'
