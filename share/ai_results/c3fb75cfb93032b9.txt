I'm falling from grace and I can't deny
Licking my health off the walls of Kentucky
Raising my eyebrows when I'm tasting your kiss
I'm trying to push this wall aside
Your heart is daring, your kiss is bold
My eyes are gritty in this room
Licking your heart is a dangerous risk
But with my lips, I'm taking the taste of your health
