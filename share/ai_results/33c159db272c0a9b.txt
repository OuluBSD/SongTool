Southern girl walking with the unknown
Bright rich colors in the morning sky
Crouching down to wave goodbye 
Ma and pa see the birds share a lonely view 
Glowin' alluring as she takes a stall 
With bold squinting eyes, there's a hint of blood 
Swaying head to side, her southern drawl 
As she waves goodbye, the birds to share 
A lonely view out in the world, dynamic with 
A mouth agape, neat hair blowing in the wind.
