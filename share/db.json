Exciting builds, sweeping risers, hard-hitting drops, modern EDM production techniques, exciting motifs, and excellent arrangements with plenty of forward motion, dynamics, and interest are all needed for this request. Modern EDM and Hip-Hop instrumentation (mixed with some sound design) will work best here. Your production and any virtual sounds or samples you use need to be high-quality and current-sounding. If you are a producer with the production chops to create this style of track, show us what you got!\n\nSubmissions should be about 2.5 minutes long, give or take.

They are fine companies, and if you're only using them to distribute your music, no problem. But, if you checked that box, you've already got a publisher or a company administrating your publishing, which means that you cannot sign that music to another publisher!\n\nThis Music Library will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share.

			"request_description": "Lots of KLEZMER SONGS with Male or Female Vocals are needed by an extremely busy Music Library with a tremendously long list of killer placements in Hit TV Shows!\n\nThis A-List Company is on the lookout for Songs in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Zol shoyn kumen di geule\" by The Klezmatics\n\n\"Basarabye\" by Itzhak Perlman\n\n\"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" by Zalmen Mlotek ft. Eleanor Reissa\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Klezmer Songs with infectious rhythms, stellar musicianship, and tons of Klezmer charm (think Fiddler on the Roof-style). Your submissions should have authentic melodies, danceable rhythms, solid arrangements, and well-crafted lyrics in Yiddish. Instrumentation should be in the general stylistic wheelhouse of traditional Klezmer music, with instruments such as Accordion, Acoustic Guitar, Nylon String Guitar, Bass Guitar, Hand Percussion, Tambourine, Strings, Concert Flute, Cimbalom (Dulcimer), Orchestral Harp, Trumpet, Piano, and Drumset. Performances should feel authentic – complete with traditional Klezmer articulations (bending the notes, forcing the breath, breathing into the notes, legato, staccato, etc.).\n\nIf you're using any virtual instruments, be sure they're super high-quality and realistic sounding. This request is all about capturing an authentic Klezmer vibe and sound!\n\nTAXI Tip: Your submissions don't need to be in one rigid tempo throughout. Historically, Klezmer music was meant for dancing, so tempos were fluid – often players slightly led or trailed the beat creating a lilting sound. Because of this, it'd actually probably be a good idea to let the rhythms of your pieces flow freely in a rubato style so they feel more authentic. The more your pieces feel like they're being performed by a real Klezmer band, the better!\n\nLyrics need to be in Yiddish and should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity. Non-faded, buttoned/stinger endings are strongly recommended. Do NOT copy the reference tracks in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: This Library really wants to find top-notch Composers – not just people who combine different samples or loops without altering them at all.  Cleared sample libraries are okay to use, but any samples or loops you include in your pieces should be altered enough that they're distinguishable from the originals. Basically, if you Shazamed one of your tracks and another artist's song comes up, your music would definitely be disqualified by this Company.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT: Your Submissions can NOT be commercially released on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., OR be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive), including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal. You’ll split all upfront sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright. Since this is an EXCLUSIVE deal, please be sure the material you submit for this pitch is not already signed with other Libraries or Catalogs. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Friday, April 26th, 2024. TAXI # S240426KL",

But, if you checked that box, you've already got a publisher or a company administrating your publishing, which means that you cannot sign that music to another publisher!\n\nThis Music Library will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recording to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Thursday, April 25th, 2024. TAXI # S240425SN",

			"request_description": "Lots of KLEZMER INSTRUMENTALS are needed by a hard-working Music Library with loads of killer placements in iconic TV shows, and lots of International representation!\n\nThis Company is searching for a range of Instrumentals in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Heyser Bulgar\" by Yxalag\n\n\"Freilach\" by Klezmer Festival Band\n\n\"Klezmer Kaos\" by Froggy Kaos\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Klezmer Instrumentals with infectious rhythms, stellar musicianship, and tons of Klezmer charm (think Fiddler on the Roof-style). Your submissions should have authentic melodies, excellent musicianship, danceable rhythms, and solid arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest. Instrumentation should be in the general stylistic wheelhouse of traditional Klezmer music, with instruments such as Accordion, Acoustic Guitar, Nylon String Guitar, Bass Guitar, Hand Percussion, Tambourine, Strings, Concert Flute, Cimbalom (Dulcimer), Orchestral Harp, Trumpet, Piano, and Drumset.  Performances should feel authentic – complete with traditional Klezmer articulations (bending the notes, forcing the breath, breathing into the notes, legato, staccato, etc.).\n\nIf you're using any virtual instruments, be sure they're super high-quality and realistic sounding. This request is all about capturing an authentic Klezmer vibe and sound!\n\nTAXI Tip: Your submissions don't need to be in one rigid tempo throughout. Historically, Klezmer music was meant for dancing, so tempos were fluid – often players slightly led or trailed the beat creating a lilting sound. Because of this, it'd actually probably be a good idea to let the rhythms of your pieces flow freely in a rubato style so they feel more authentic. The more your pieces feel like they're being performed by a real Klezmer band, the better!\n\nAll submissions should be about 2 to 4 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, buttoned endings are strongly recommended. Do NOT copy the reference tracks in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of ANY other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: This Library really wants to find top-notch Composers – not just people who combine different samples or loops without altering them at all. Cleared sample libraries are okay to use, but any samples or loops you include in your pieces should be altered enough that they're distinguishable from the originals. Basically, if you Shazamed one of your tracks and another artist's song comes up, your music would definitely be disqualified by this Company.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT: Your Submissions can NOT be commercially released on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., OR be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive), including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc. Distribution agreements are fine. It's publishing, licensing, and publishing administration deals that are the problem.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal. You’ll split all upfront sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright. Since this is an EXCLUSIVE deal, please be sure the material you submit for this pitch is not already signed with other Libraries or Catalogs. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Sunday, April 28th, 2024. TAXI # S240428ZR",

			"request_description": "Lots of HIGH-ENERGY HIP-HOP SONGS (in a wide range of styles) with Male or Female Vocals are needed by a successful International Music Library with an impressive track record of great placements in TV, Film, and Commercials!\n\nThis Library is looking for several Mid-to-Up-Tempo Songs that could be heard on a playlist with the following examples we got directly from the CEO of the Company:\n\nWARNING: The references may include graphic and explicit lyrics. Listener discretion is advised.\n\nDUCKWRTH - POWER POWER\n\nRun It - DJ Snake -  (ft. Rick Ross & Rich Brian)\n\nRun The Jewels - Blockbuster Night Part 1\n\nStart to Finish - Slizzy McGuire\n\nQuoting the Company's CEO: \"These Songs need to be high energy, fast-paced, and sports/promo-friendly. Dynamic and detailed production is key, coupled with powerful vocal and lyrical performances.\"\n\nPlease submit well-produced Hip-Hop Songs full of epic, hard-hitting energy that could work well for a variety of placements in Film and TV. Your submissions should have hard-hitting beats and rhythms, loads of energy and intensity, memorable hooks, slick lyrical flows, solid arrangements, and powerful, well-crafted lyrics. Vocal performances need to be raw, unapologetic and well-performed. Instrumentation can vary based on your approach, but a hybrid approach to Hip-Hop in the general stylistic ballpark of the references will work best (think synths, sound design, cinematic drums, brass stabs, etc.). Please be sure your production is dynamic, detailed, and modern. Any virtual sounds or samples you use should be high-quality and not dated-sounding.\n\nLyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity are strongly recommended. Non-faded, Buttoned/Stinger endings are needed for this request. Do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This Library will need 30-second and 60-second versions of your Songs AS WELL AS stems, but not yet! All you need to submit for now are the Full Songs, but please have 30-second and 60-second versions, AND stems on hand, and ready-to-go. Please read the next paragraph carefully...\n\nCritical FYI: The 30-second and 60-second versions are likely to be used for advertising, so they actually need to end at :29.5 seconds and :59.5 seconds, including reverb tails and instrument ring outs. TV and radio stations use computers to switch from one thing to another on VERY precise schedules, so if your reverb tails or instrument ring outs exceed :29.5 seconds and/or :59.5 seconds, your music will not work, and cannot be used.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. If you've checked the box to have your music \"monetized,\" published, or administrated by a company like CDBaby, TuneCore, or SongTrust, you CAN NOT submit for this request. They are fine companies, and if you're only using them to distribute your music, no problem. But, if you checked that box, you've already got a publisher or a company administrating your publishing, which means that you cannot sign that music to another publisher!\n\nThis Music Library will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recording to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD.

If you have Songs that could be the next crossover Pop/Rock hit, send them in!\n\nIMPORTANT: This Executive is interested in artists and bands that have gained some traction from actively working on their careers. Please detail (in your bio) what you are doing with your career. Include any impressive touring, fan base, sales, streaming, or social media figures. That said – if you’re a new artist or band just starting out and don’t have much of a story or track record, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Songs to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nTAXI Tip: We recommend submitting at least 2 Songs per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for texture and tone.\n\nPlease submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include lyrics, photos, and a bio. All submissions will be screened by a TAXI A&R Team Member who has a strong relationship with the Executive.

However, there is one area in which we feel we could do better. Therefor, we are seeking Pop music to represent for licensing in films, TV shows and ad campaigns. By “Pop” we are referring more to the broad appeal of the music than the genre. As long as the song has hit potential, we would like to hear it. Genre wise we are open, but indie pop and indie folk seem to work best for licensing placements. \n\nHere are some great examples of music that we would like to have in our catalog: \n\n- The Lumineers - Ho Hey\n- Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home\n- Charli XCX - Break The Rules\n- James Bay - Hold Back The River\n\nWe accept ONE-STOP submissions only, ie songs that you own or control 100% (writer, master and publisher). Please submit only professionally recorded and mastered songs. NO DEMOS, NO COVERS.\n\nAs an added bonus, if your song is Selected, we will offer to release your music on Filter Label. The songs by our talented artists can be heard in The OA, Exatlon, The Matrix Revisited, CSI: Las Vegas, Nikita, on ads for McDonald's, Nestle Wagner, Nike, Philip Morris, Hachette Filipacchi, in shows on MTV, CNN, Bravo, Nat Geo, NBC, Esquire, Channel 4 and almost every major TV network in the world.- Emil Hadji -Panzov Founder / CEO - Filter Label",

Ie, Drum & Bass, Hip-Hop, Dubstep, Electronica, Edm, Trap, Grime, Experimental etc. \n  \nAll tracks must be upbeat and have a “Phat Beat”, “Killer Beat”, “Sick Beats”, “Dope Beat” or whatever your preferred description would be. \n   \nMusic must be well produced, high-quality, mixed and mastered. Instrumental tracks preferred please, but great vocal tracks can be accepted too (if you can supply instrumental versions even better) and all tempos considered. \n  \nArtists must own all rights to their music 100% on both sides and there must be no copyright infringement. All music will be listened to, reviewed and feedback given.  \n  \nThe average cost of TV advertising commercial in Korea is $800 to $1,500 per track, and for worldwide rights up to $14,000. \n   \nThe average cost of Online & YouTube advertising in Korea is $500-$2500 (geo restricted for single country of Korea), and worldwide use for $3000-$5000.  \n  \nSelected tracks be sent to clients in South Korea and music licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), we simply go 50-50 on deals we get and you're paid quarterly.   \n \nThe South Korean market is built on a unique structure, which is not the same as any foreign market structure around the world. Because of this Korea has a higher advertising music fee than most other countries. This may be due to systemic limitations that the performing royalties cannot be collected, but also because there is no subsequent secondary payment after the initial payment of music fees. The total amount paid in Korea is 100% mechanical payout. \n  \nClients who will be using music in South Korea; Korea's major advertising agencies including the CHEIL and INOCEAN and brands such as; Samsung, LG, Hyundai and SK to name a few. \n  \nIf you make “beats’ I really look forward to hearing from you ! \n  \nAll the best,  \n- Giles Gale -\nMusic supervisor, sync & Licensing Manager - Resonant Music Licensing",

While the visuals feature tropical scenes, young adults having fun and splashing in the sea, the creative team wants to stir away from the typical Summer banger. Tonally, the track should feel fun and energetic, while retaining a level of surprise and sophistication. The focus of this search is hitting the right tone, the track can be old, new, featuring female or male vocals. We are open to several directions, however something with a timeless, vintage inspired sound would contrast the visuals well.\n\nGood luck and please DO NOT contact us directly or via Social Media as this will not be read or listened to.\n\nMuch Love\n\nAlex\nGrand Northern Sync",

			"request_description": "Seeking Covers of Hit Songs for Licensing PlacementsThe post houses and advertising agencies we work with seem to have a never ending demand for covers of popular songs. Therefor, we would like to broaden our catalog with inventive cover versions of compositions that have been big worldwide hits.\n\nWe are not looking for interpretations trying to imitate the original. We are seeking just the opposite - new takes on well known songs which transport them to new, unexpected directions. Covers are usually considered for film trailers and big ad campaigns, so it would be great to hear submissions that have space and a “cinematic” sound. However, if you have a dynamic, aggressive cover of a slow song, that could work too.\n\n\nBelow are some brilliant examples of what we would like to hear: \n\n- Skylar Grey - Addicted To Love\n- Vega Choir - Creep\n- Lo-Fang - You’re The One That I Want\n- Hannah Peel - Tainted Love\n- Think Up Anger feat. Malia J - Smells Like Teen Spirit\n- Lorde - Everybody Wants To Rule The World\n- KI Theory - Enjoy The Silence\n\nPlease submit only professionally recorded and mastered songs.\n\nAs an added bonus, if your cover is Selected, we will offer to release your music on Filter Label. The songs by our talented artists can be heard in The OA, Exatlon, The Matrix Revisited, CSI: Las Vegas, Nikita, on ads for McDonald's, Nike, Philip Morris, Nestle Wagner, Bank Millennium, in shows on MTV, CNN, Nat Geo, NBC, Al Jazeera, Esquire, Channel 4 and almost every major TV network in the world.- Emil Hadji Panzov Founder / CEO - Filter Label",

			"request_description": "Seeking Fun and Driving Songs for a Telecom Commercial - $10K - $15K payoutWe are seeking music for a European telecom commercial. There are two possible musical directions specified below, but some general guidelines are: fun, dynamic, interesting, preferably with some structural and/or tempo changes, slightly quirky. Both instrumentals and songs with vocals are welcome. If you are submitting a song with vocals, please make sure that the lyrics are not too specific.\n\n\nDIRECTION 1 - \"Heist\" music, fun, but with a dose of suspense, similar to the Ocean's 11 soundtracks by David Holmes.\n\n- SWAT Team Exit\n- Gritty Shaker\n\n\nDIRECTION 2 - Driving modern music (Indie Pop, Hip-Hop, Funk or R&B) with cutting edge and slightly unusual approach to production.\n\n- Work It\n- Drop It Like It's Hot\n\nWe accept ONE-STOP submissions only, ie songs that you own or control 100% (writer, master and publisher). Please submit only professionally recorded and mastered songs. NO DEMOS, NO SAMPLES.\n\nAs an added bonus, if your song is Selected, we will ask you to send us more of your music for consideration. The songs by our talented artists can be heard in Shameless, Legacies, The OA, Exatlon, The Matrix Revisited, CSI, Nikita, in commercials for Sony, Samsung, McDonald's, Nestle Wagner, Nike, Mytheresa, Fenty Beauty, Philip Morris, Bank Millennium, Becutan, Masterclass, Hachette Filipacchi, in shows on MTV, CNN, National Geographic, NBC, Bravo, Esquire, Channel 4 and almost every major TV network in the world.",

We lean toward a more melancholy sound so please no “fun” or overly “happy” songs. At the moment we are only seeking single songs.

The songwriter/writers will retain 100% of the writing credit and will receive all royalties for their share. In addition, an advance will be paid to the writer/performer for the song in an amount to be determined. The advance then becomes a recoupable expense. After the advance is recouped, all income generated by the song will be split 50/50. \n\nOur label is distributed by our digital aggregator, The Orchard, and releases will be available on every major retailer and streaming service including iTunes, Spotify, IHeartRadio, Amazon, YouTube, Google Music, rDio, Shazam, Flipagram, etc. - Jason Currie / Dog Bites Wolf\nDeal Type: Catalog Inclusion\nDecision Maker: We are the final decision maker\nDeal Structure: Exclusive\nCompensation: $251 - $500\nSong Quality: Rough Mixes, Fully mastered, Broadcast ready\nSimilar Sounding Artists: Nikki Lane, William Fitzsimmons, Jason Isbell, Lykke Li, Iron & Wine, Sturgill Simpson, Margo Price",

The season leaves the audience on the edge, and we need a track that will highlight the mystery and thrill of what’s to come. Tonally, it should sound modern and exciting, something with a moody and darker feel to it. A track that builds from a soft introduction into a bass heavy, percussive chorus would tick all boxes. While lyrics requirements are open, the track should convey power and confidence. \n\nGood Luck \n\nMuch Love\nAlex\nGrand Northern Sync",

Instrumental music preferred please, but great vocals welcome (but please make sure you can supply instrumental version as well) and all tempos, required.  \n\nAdditionally, covers of old classics such as Silent Night which are copyright free would be great too!\n\nArtists must own all rights to their music 100% and there must be no copyright infringement.  \n\nSelected tracks will be pro-actively pitched to our clients for relevant sync opportunities for use in their Christmas campaigns. Clients are film & video production companies, advertising agencies and a few game developers that make high-end content. \n\nMusic used by clients will be licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), simply go 50-50 on deals we get for you, you’re paid quarterly and keep 100% of all royalties generated from placements. Artist's will receive between £100-£10,000 per use depending on use, type of project etc, so, if you have any great Christmas music for sync, I’d really love to hear from you! \n\nNB; If you have already submitted and had music accepted into our catalogue that is suitable for this brief, you don’t need to re-submit as your music will automatically be pitched to our clients. Thanks! \n\nLooking forward to hearing and working with you :) \n \nAll the best, \nGiles Gale \nMusic Supervisor",

			"request_description": "Radio Blast: Online stations worldwide\nIt's very simple. We save time and reach more stations than artists could, on their own.\nOur lists cover around 90% of radio station contacts worldwide. For example, in USA, there are aprox. 4,500 online radios and online stations. We have around 4,000 contacts just in The States. Artist sends a radio ready, mixed and mastered song, along with short biography, 4-5 pictures, and logo if possible. We put together a nice looking e-mail, with pure facts about the artist, info on song that's being submitted and artists (or artists management contact information). We believe that it's fair to keep artists direct contact public, so if radio stations want to reach out, they can reach out DIRECTLY to the artist.",

My friend played me a rough demo and wasn't sure about it. I nearly fainted, \"That's Top Ten my friend\" I told him.\n\nI was wrong. It went to Number One in the UK for three weeks!\n\nI hear hits. It's in my DNA. So let me hear what you have and I will give you my brutally honest critique. I will not blow smoke at you. I will tell you what I think and what could be done (if needed) to make it better. \n\nObviously if I love it then I will want to talk business with you too but that is for later.\n\nOK the future is yours for the taking.\n\nMusically yours, Tim H",

This is a continuation of that original musical idea.\n\nIn the past and the present he has been known to play folk, country, rap/hip-hop, punk, classical, power pop and everything in between.  At this point, he's making an effort to include eclectic and original hardcore into the mix to keep his mixed musical explorations on some sort of cutting edge (in his mind if nowhere else....). Once upon a time, he even segued from Carl Perkins into Public Enemy. Yes, his musical tastes are that eclectic, and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as he does. - Michael Perazzetti / Radio Casbah \nDeal Type: Radio Airplay\nWhere is this radio station heard?: Online\nRadio Format: Freeform Radio\nSimilar Sounding Artists: Originals and Public Domain covers only, please",

And more than ever, even if we have heard a track before and selected or passed on it, THIS is absolutely the opp to re-submit to.\n\nSo, tracks can be….\n\nAlternative, Blues, Childrens Music, Christian & Gospel, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Easy Listening, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop, Holiday, Indie, Industrial, Instrumental, Jazz, Latin, Metal, New Age, Pop, R&B/Soul, Rap, Reggae, Rock, and World. Tracks with vocals (of course) as well as instrumentals. \n\nAgain payments generally range from $1,000 to $5,000 plus. I truly believe this will be a great foot up the ladder for any artist.\n\nLast date for submissions to potentially get yourself included on the One Night Stand Music and Media (sync) Roster is the 23rd of December 2021.\n\n- Stuart Cheese / One Night Stand Music and Media / Concerto-XL",

It is no surprise that the music pioneer received a Grammy nomination for R&B Songwriter of the Year for the hit song “Casanova” in 1987. \n\nBest known as the founder and leader of one of the most popular Techno-funk bands, Midnight Star, Calloway led the group to international success by writing, producing and arranging a string of top mega #1 hits including, “Operator,” “No Parking On The Dance Floor,” “I Wanna Be Rich” and “Freak-a-zoid.” \n\nOne of Calloway’s original compositions entitled, “I’ll Be Good For You,” was featured on N’Sync’s multi-platinum CD, No Strings Attached (highest selling album of the last decade). He has also penned songs for the chart-topping group Levert (“Casanova”), the sultry Teddy Pendergrass (“Joy”), Grammy-winning Gladys Knight (“Love Overboard”) and “Jump Start My Love” for Natalie Cole.",

We are looking for artists with exceptional, recognizable voices and styles to sign to our artist development company. Your ability to write your own songs is a plus but not a necessity.\nPlease give us a detailed description of your performing experience, artists with whom you identify and who have influenced you, known artist(s) for whom you could open, and the amount of touring you would be able to do based on your relationships and/or job. If you would like us to hear complete songs, submit them, or if you'd rather give us a taste of some different songs, you can submit a show reel medley not longer than five minutes. For every submission, we'll open a conversation with you so we can go further than just a critique of the submission. That conversation will stay open until we've given you every observation and piece of advice we can think of. We won't mince words, so be prepared to get an extremely detailed and honest evaluation of your talent, including what we think your strengths and weaknesses are and what we believe your chances of making it as an artist would be. A small percentage of artists rise to the top. If you aspire to be in that number, let us hear from you. This opportunity is somewhat higher in price than the average opportunity on Xray because we will take the time to deeply evaluate your songs, videos and links. We can't guarantee that we will be able to work with you, but at the minimum, you'll benefit from our 50 years experience in the music industry.- Warren Ells -\nOwner - SeaSoDeep Music and SeaBeyondShore Music ASCAP",

The music and bands on the show range from punk rock legends to soon to be the next big thing. The best thing about the show is that I run the radio station which isn't FCC regulated so people can hear how the music should be and whatever the bands say are uncensored.- Jack Low -\nOwner - Punk Rock Demonstration\nDeal Type: Radio Airplay\nWhere is this radio station heard?: Online\nRadio Format: Freeform Radio\nSimilar Sounding Artists: exploited, casualties, briggs, starving wolves, krum bums, lower class brats, oxymoron, tower blocks, generators, resist, defiance, bad engrish, violent affair",

I will provide honest and constructive feedback on your music, including elements such as composition, arrangement, production, and mixing. My aim is to help you improve your music and take it to the next level.\n\nIn my critiques, I will highlight the strengths of your track and suggest areas that need improvement, including advice on how to enhance the sonic quality of your recording. I have worked with a wide range of music genres, from pop to hip-hop, rock to R&B, and more, so I have a broad understanding of what makes a great track in various styles.\n\nUpon completion of the critique, any fees charged will appear in your account, and you will receive a detailed written critique. You will have the option to start a two-way conversation, where I can answer any further questions or clarify any comments made in the critique.

Preferably looking for full songs with either male or female vocals or both.  Songs can be about any subject matter as long as they aren't so specific that their use would be limited.  For instance, if lyrics talk about a specific year or event in pop culture or history or mention being in a specific city or country, that may limit our ability to use the song.\nWe are looking for great Hard Rock Anthems for pitching to CBS Sports and Fox Sports for the upcoming NFL season.  Songs should be current sounding and compare to leading artists and songs in the genre.\n\nIf we think your submission may fit, we will place it on hold for further review by the entire team working on this project.  If it is selected, we will contact you further with details. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a “submission-only” dropbox.  We are looking for the perfect song for this pitch.  We will not be giving detailed feedback on submissions.  Either we feel the song may fit the brief or it doesn’t.  We apologize for not being able to give feedback beyond whether it fits or not, but the time constraints of the nature of these projects will not allow us the time to give in-depth feedback on the song.  We will, however, submit ratings on every submission.Incorporated Elements is a company that works with songwriters, artists, producers, and DJ's to help them perfect their craft and fully realize the potential in their art.

			"request_description": "Song Critiques & Career Coaching From Reggie CallowayReggie Calloway is eager to offer you his ear, taste, and professional criteria to make your music better, more adapted to what the industry is currently seeking, and general songwriting advice.\n\nAdditionally, and based on the questions you ask in the submission message space, Reggie will answer specific questions about your career path and strategy.\n\nThe five time Grammy-nominated Reggie Calloway has always displayed a unique ear for music and trends. It is no surprise that the music pioneer received a Grammy nomination for R&B Songwriter of the Year for the hit song “Casanova” in 1987.\n\nBest known as the founder and leader of one of the most popular Techno-funk bands, Midnight Star, Calloway led the group to international success by writing, producing and arranging a string of top mega #1 hits including, “Operator,” “No Parking On The Dance Floor,” “I Wanna Be Rich” and “Freak-a-zoid.”\n\nOne of Calloway’s original compositions entitled, “I’ll Be Good For You,” was featured on N’Sync’s multi-platinum CD, No Strings Attached (highest selling album of the last decade). He has also penned songs for the chart-topping group Levert (“Casanova”), the sultry Teddy Pendergrass (“Joy”), Grammy-winning Gladys Knight (“Love Overboard”) and “Jump Start My Love” for Natalie Cole.",

However, the equipped studio (appropriately dubbed the WRECKROOM) has evolved, becoming a breeding ground for fresh talent -- a music incubator. \n\nThe Wreckroom seeks to develop and promote artists who are pushing creative boundaries. Artists are vetted by Grenier and his team: Damien Paris, Mike Frankel, and Brian Koerber. Selected musicians join the team for a full day session, in which they professionally record an original song and film a live-style music video.",

L7 Music Group is a worldwide digital distribution, publishing and licensing company that strives to take indie artists, from all genres, to the next level. We were founded in February 2017 with over 40 years of hands-on experience in the music industry, collectively. Our growing company excels in getting artists’ music to the masses and getting them paid for their musical works. Unlike most distribution services, we do not charge a fee to distribute with our company. Instead, we split the profits with our artists 80-20, with the artist taking the lion’s share of the profits from their music. We distribute to over 250 downloading & streaming markets and have an 85% success rate on getting artists music in rotation on Pandora. We realize that times have changed and that the method of hand-to-hand CD sells is slowing diminishing, so we've decided to assist artists in building an online presence by offering our services to those artists who really want to be heard, foreign and domestic.- Geoffrey Domingues -\nCEO - L7 Music Group",

APPLY AND SUBMIT FOR FREE IF YOU’RE INTERESTED!\n\nAward-winning multi platinum selling songwriter/producer together with Sony Music, is looking for the new pop male group / boy band to globally release and promote the brand new hit potential 90’s pop song “Come on”. Name of the male group / boy band will be “High Five”. \n\nWe are looking to form a group of five male singers from between 18 and 35 years.  Are you a professional male singer (between 18 and 35) with a great voice, or you are not a professional yet, but you believe or people say you have talent, and interested in committing to this project, then please apply for free, we ask no submission fee.  We accept acapella submissions as well as full demo versions. The quality does not have to be top notch, just as long as we can hear your singing voice clearly.\n\nOur mission is to become very successful, as we believe this song that will be released including videoclip, is really strong. When the song would become a success, we will be recording at least six other brand-new 90’s pop songs with lots of harmonies and great melodies and we will be touring in many countries.\n\nPlease note: We treat everybody equal; all singers would get equally paid when doing gigs/shows, and they have an equal position / equal vote in the group as we are looking for five equally strong voices. You are not treated as a number like many group members of boybands in the past were treated. So we do not have one solo singer and four “backing vocals”. We accept any male between 18 and 35, just as long as your voice is at least above average.\n\nArtist/Talents: Here is the hidden link to the hidden demo song \"Come on\" (with reference vocals) that we are talking about, that is set to be recorded and released as soon as we have the group together.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzH4CQ7G6HQ\n\nSuccess and best wishes!\n\n- Key Music Entertainment / Creativity Factory",

			"request_description": "Offering song critiques for J-pop and K-pop marketsIn this dropbox, Audity Music is offering the opportunity for expert critique of your song with an eye towards helping you understand what is required to make records that work in the Japan and Korea markets. \n\nAudity has an especially strong niche in Asia, having relationships with top songwriters, producers, record labels, publishers and other key players that are difficult to rival. Our on-the-ground experience in Japan and Korea has given us the opportunity to develop a unique expertise in both markets. Now, we are offering to share our knowledge with you in order to boost your chances of successful pitching and placement in Asia. A lot of writers come to us seeking information about and access to the Asia markets. Here's your chance.\n\nWhy YOU should consider Asia?\n\nJapan is the second largest music market in the world, not very far behind the U.S. in terms of annual music revenues. If you ignore Japan, you could be giving up substantial income as a songwriter; indeed you may find that income in Japan exceeds income in your home market if you can create the music sought in the Japanese market and have the right avenues in which to pitch it. Additionally, Korea is a very strong market in Asia that tends to lean a bit more Western in its music soundscape. the K-pop market has been growing increasingly strong in recent years, especially on the international scene as Korean record labels have been excellent as pushing K-Pop outside of Korea and even outside of Asia to Europe, America, South America, etc.\n\nChina/Taiwan is another growing force to be reckoned with and strongly considered by songwriters as China's intellectual property protection and licensing regime comes into form. You will find that all the major U.S. labels, Korean labels, Japanese labels, etc are now partnering with Chinese companies to be prepared for when China's regime truly comes online. And, Mandopop is a strong force in China, largely emanating from Taiwan.\n\nIf you want Audity Music's expertise on Asia markets for your benefit, submit here! We encourage writers to pursue the diversification of markets for their music and always have an international mindset. Music is the universal language after all!\n\nIf we REALLY like your song(s) and think has placement potential with some additional production/editing/co-writing, we may be in touch via direct message to work further with you and offer such services. And, if we think your song(s) is already a good fit for the markets, we may reach out to discuss representation of your music in Asia and beyond. Again, Asia is our particularly unique niche. However, we pitch music around the world. We're not here to just take fees. We want to find great writers and work with them! Our expert critiques will take time significantly more time than simply voting \"Selected\" or \"Not Selected\", thus the higher submission fee. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your songs!\n- Audity Music, LLC",

Take advantage of this opportunity to get your music in front of a seasoned professional who can help. Stuart Epps is happy to receive your submissions and provide you with a thoughtful song critique. He will provide his opinion on the song, the production or any other aspect that is of particular interest to you as well as Stuart's opinion regarding the commercial viability of the track. Stuart will also consider songs submitted to this drop box for potential production / development deals and will contact you about this to gauge your interest if he is blown away by what he hears. If you would simply like to be considered for a production / development deal and do not want a critique please submit to Stuart's other drop box under this profile. For most production deals there will be a fee involved which will be discussed. Some of Epps' most noteworthy clients have included Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Chris Rea, George Harrison, Mick Fleetwood, Barry White, George Michael, Mark Owen, Cliff Richard, Twisted Sister, Brian Adams, Oasis, Kiki Dee, Robbie Williams, Bill Wyman and of course Elton John. In recent years he has continued to work with big name artists to great acclaim, as well as helping a host of promising new and up-and-coming artists to sound their best, both on demo recordings and in full studio productions.",

You have a chance to also score shows with us!

You must have clean versions available, and you must own master and publishing rights! Huge opportunity!\n\nIf you have music in our catalog, your music is automatically being considered.\n\n- Eddie Sea / Music Of The Sea\n\nWhy the higher than average submission fee?\n\nOften we hear music that doesn’t make the final cut for a particular opportunity but we go ahead and select the song anyway because we believe the song is appropriate for other opportunities we’re working on. Here at Music of The Sea, we fill dozens of sync requests every week. We don’t have time to listen to everything so the higher submission fee tends to discourage all but the best - and we sign a lot of music and we place almost all of it.\n\nWe only offer one deal and the terms are the same for everyone, so don’t submit if you’re seeking another type of deal. If we select your song, you give us exclusive rights to the song for 3 years. If after three years we haven’t licensed your song, the rights revert back to you. If we do license your song, we share in the revenue. Often, if we love the song we hear and want to work with you we will also have interest in hearing other songs in your catalog and possibly doing a broader deal.",

Clients are professional film makers, TV/video production companies, games developers, advertising agencies etc, that produce high-end content. \n\nMusic used by clients will be licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), we simply go 50-50 on deals we get for you, you’re paid quarterly and keep 100% of all royalties generated from placements. \n \nArtist's will receive between £50-£1,000+ per track depending on use, type of project etc, and music will be available for all licensing opportunities. So, if you have any amazing Hip Hop tracks, I’d really love to hear from you! \n\nNB; If you have already had music accepted into our catalogue that is suitable for this brief, you don’t need to re-submit as your music will automatically be pitched to our clients.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your music and working with you!\n \nAll the best, \nGiles Gale \n\nMusic Supervisor",

We are actively seeking songs to pitch to Big Machine Records for this iconic country superstar. Tim's signature sound is what has made him a legend, and we're looking for songs that stay true to that sound while also bringing a fresh and modern edge to them musically and melodically. With Tim's current single \"Standing Room Only\" setting the bar high, we need songs that are equally as radio-ready and appealing to modern country audiences. No album filler songs here - we want songs that will compete with the likes of Morgan Wallen and Hardy. So, if you're a songwriter with a passion for country music, submit your best works in the lane of what Tim has done in the past, with a contemporary twist that will make your songs stand out and shine!- Ray Hamilton - President of A&R - Merf Music Group",

With this coalition of local talent, it developed into a booking agency focused on expanding the platform for the artists who are often overlooked and underappreciated. In this mindset, we've grown immensely due to a team who themselves are just as passionate about music as the artists they work with. At TFAK, we believe in changing the way the music industry works for those artists looking to build a lasting career from an independent level and above. We believe in the concepts of DIY, highlighting undiscovered music, and building a lasting brand that works towards the independent music scene of today. ",
