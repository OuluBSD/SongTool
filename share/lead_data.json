The dynamics are key.\"\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Hybrid Hip-Hop/EDM Instrumentals that are exploding with epic, bombastic energy! Exciting builds, sweeping risers, hard-hitting drops, modern EDM production techniques, exciting motifs, and excellent arrangements with plenty of forward motion, dynamics, and interest are all needed for this request. Modern EDM and Hip-Hop instrumentation (mixed with some sound design) will work best here. Your production and any virtual sounds or samples you use need to be high-quality and current-sounding. If you are a producer with the production chops to create this style of track, show us what you got!\n\nSubmissions should be about 2.5 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, Buttoned/Stinger endings are needed for this pitch. Do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This Library will need 30-second and 60-second versions of your Instrumentals AS WELL AS stems, but not yet! All you need to submit for now are the Full Instrumentals, but please have 30-second and 60-second versions, AND stems on hand ready to go. Read the next paragraph carefully...\n\nCritical FYI: The 30-second and 60-second versions are likely to be used for advertising, so they actually need to end at :29.5 seconds and :59.5 seconds, including reverb tails and instrument ring outs. TV and radio stations use computers to switch from one thing to another on VERY precise schedules, so if your reverb tails or instrument ring outs exceed :29.5 seconds and/or :59.5 seconds, your music will not work, and cannot be used.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. If you've checked the box to have your music \"monetized,\" published, or administrated by a company like CDBaby, TuneCore, or SongTrust, you CAN NOT submit for this request. They are fine companies, and if you're only using them to distribute your music, no problem.

			"request_description": "Lots of KLEZMER SONGS with Male or Female Vocals are needed by an extremely busy Music Library with a tremendously long list of killer placements in Hit TV Shows!\n\nThis A-List Company is on the lookout for Songs in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Zol shoyn kumen di geule\" by The Klezmatics\n\n\"Basarabye\" by Itzhak Perlman\n\n\"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" by Zalmen Mlotek ft. Eleanor Reissa\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Klezmer Songs with infectious rhythms, stellar musicianship, and tons of Klezmer charm (think Fiddler on the Roof-style). Your submissions should have authentic melodies, danceable rhythms, solid arrangements, and well-crafted lyrics in Yiddish. Instrumentation should be in the general stylistic wheelhouse of traditional Klezmer music, with instruments such as Accordion, Acoustic Guitar, Nylon String Guitar, Bass Guitar, Hand Percussion, Tambourine, Strings, Concert Flute, Cimbalom (Dulcimer), Orchestral Harp, Trumpet, Piano, and Drumset. Performances should feel authentic – complete with traditional Klezmer articulations (bending the notes, forcing the breath, breathing into the notes, legato, staccato, etc.).\n\nIf you're using any virtual instruments, be sure they're super high-quality and realistic sounding. This request is all about capturing an authentic Klezmer vibe and sound!\n\nTAXI Tip: Your submissions don't need to be in one rigid tempo throughout. Historically, Klezmer music was meant for dancing, so tempos were fluid – often players slightly led or trailed the beat creating a lilting sound. Because of this, it'd actually probably be a good idea to let the rhythms of your pieces flow freely in a rubato style so they feel more authentic. The more your pieces feel like they're being performed by a real Klezmer band, the better!\n\nLyrics need to be in Yiddish and should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity. Non-faded, buttoned/stinger endings are strongly recommended. Do NOT copy the reference tracks in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: This Library really wants to find top-notch Composers – not just people who combine different samples or loops without altering them at all.  Cleared sample libraries are okay to use, but any samples or loops you include in your pieces should be altered enough that they're distinguishable from the originals. Basically, if you Shazamed one of your tracks and another artist's song comes up, your music would definitely be disqualified by this Company.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT: Your Submissions can NOT be commercially released on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., OR be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive), including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal. You’ll split all upfront sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright. Since this is an EXCLUSIVE deal, please be sure the material you submit for this pitch is not already signed with other Libraries or Catalogs. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

The general vibe and style of this song is what we're going for with this one.\"\n\nPlease submit moody, '80s-inspired Alt-Rock Songs that capture the overall vibe and style of the reference! But please take note: They are NOT looking for a clone of the reference song! Your submissions should have hypnotic melodies, catchy choruses, well-crafted lyrics, engaging rhythms, and expressive, well-performed Male vocals. Instrumentation that's in the general stylistic wheelhouse of reference will suit your submissions best (think guitars, drums, '80s-inspired synths, bass, etc.). If you have high-quality vintage recordings (recorded back in the day) that match the vibe and style they are looking for, they would love to hear those as well!\n\nLyrics should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, brands, places, and profanity. Do NOT copy the referenced example in any way, shape, or form. Use it only as a general guide for tempo, tone, texture, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed. Era-appropriate Broadcast Quality will work for vintage recordings.\n\nIMPORTANT: They will need instrumental-only versions of your Songs as well, but not yet! All you need to submit for now are the Full Songs with Vocals, but please have mix-minus-vocal versions on hand and ready to send at a moment’s notice if you get a call or email from the Music Library.\n\nThis company offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 split. You’ll split any upfront sync fees 50/50.

Indie Singer/Songwriter instrumentation that falls within the general stylistic ballpark of the references will work best for this opportunity (think acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keys, drums percussion, etc.).

Compelling and well-performed vocals are the way to go.\n\nThis Label has specifically asked to hear at least 2 Songs per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nNOTE: This Label is interested in Artists and Bands that have gained some traction from actively working on their careers. Please detail (in your bio) what you are doing with your career. Include any impressive touring, fan base, sales, streaming, or social media figures. That said – if you’re a new Artist or Band just starting out and don’t have much of a story or track record, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Songs to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Please do NOT copy the referenced artists or songs in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, texture, and tone.\n\nPlease submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include lyrics, photos, and a bio. All submissions will be screened by a TAXI A&R Team Member who has a strong relationship with the company.

They need a fusion of credible hip-hop beats and some awkward/quirky sounds, which has traditionally been with pizzicato strings... but we’re also looking to evolve this sound with fresh ideas and interpretations that give the same overall feel. A 3-part structure works well for these. 1) introduce the main theme, 2) provide an edit point that leads to a new melody or introduction of a new element, and 3) return to the main theme in a crescendo.\"\n\nPlease submit well-crafted, Hip-Hop Dramedy Instrumentals that could add a quirky or funny mood to a scene from a Reality TV Show! Your submissions should have playful motifs, engaging beats, and dynamic arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest throughout. Instrumentation that's in the general wheelhouse of the references will work best (Hip-Hop beats, pizzicato strings, etc.). Please make sure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high quality and not dated-sounding.\n\nSubmissions should be about 2.5 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, Buttoned/Stinger endings are needed for this pitch. Do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This Library will need 30-second and 60-second versions of your Instrumentals AS WELL AS stems, but not yet! All you need to submit for now are the Full Instrumentals, but please have 30-second and 60-second versions, AND stems on hand ready to go. Read the next paragraph carefully...\n\nCritical FYI: The 30-second and 60-second versions are likely to be used for advertising, so they actually need to end at 29.5 seconds and 59.5 seconds, including reverb tails and instrument ring-outs. TV and radio stations use computers to switch from one thing to another on VERY precise schedules, so if your reverb tails or instrument ring-outs exceed 29.5 seconds and/or 59.5 seconds, your music will not work, and cannot be used.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. If you've checked the box to have your music \"monetized,\" published, or administrated by a company like CDBaby, TuneCore, or SongTrust, you CAN NOT submit for this request. They are fine companies, and if you're only using them to distribute your music, no problem. But, if you checked that box, you've already got a publisher or a company administrating your publishing, which means that you cannot sign that music to another publisher!\n\nThis Music Library will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share.

			"request_description": "Lots of KLEZMER INSTRUMENTALS are needed by a hard-working Music Library with loads of killer placements in iconic TV shows, and lots of International representation!\n\nThis Company is searching for a range of Instrumentals in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Heyser Bulgar\" by Yxalag\n\n\"Freilach\" by Klezmer Festival Band\n\n\"Klezmer Kaos\" by Froggy Kaos\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Klezmer Instrumentals with infectious rhythms, stellar musicianship, and tons of Klezmer charm (think Fiddler on the Roof-style). Your submissions should have authentic melodies, excellent musicianship, danceable rhythms, and solid arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest. Instrumentation should be in the general stylistic wheelhouse of traditional Klezmer music, with instruments such as Accordion, Acoustic Guitar, Nylon String Guitar, Bass Guitar, Hand Percussion, Tambourine, Strings, Concert Flute, Cimbalom (Dulcimer), Orchestral Harp, Trumpet, Piano, and Drumset.  Performances should feel authentic – complete with traditional Klezmer articulations (bending the notes, forcing the breath, breathing into the notes, legato, staccato, etc.).\n\nIf you're using any virtual instruments, be sure they're super high-quality and realistic sounding. This request is all about capturing an authentic Klezmer vibe and sound!\n\nTAXI Tip: Your submissions don't need to be in one rigid tempo throughout. Historically, Klezmer music was meant for dancing, so tempos were fluid – often players slightly led or trailed the beat creating a lilting sound. Because of this, it'd actually probably be a good idea to let the rhythms of your pieces flow freely in a rubato style so they feel more authentic. The more your pieces feel like they're being performed by a real Klezmer band, the better!\n\nAll submissions should be about 2 to 4 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, buttoned endings are strongly recommended. Do NOT copy the reference tracks in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of ANY other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: This Library really wants to find top-notch Composers – not just people who combine different samples or loops without altering them at all. Cleared sample libraries are okay to use, but any samples or loops you include in your pieces should be altered enough that they're distinguishable from the originals. Basically, if you Shazamed one of your tracks and another artist's song comes up, your music would definitely be disqualified by this Company.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT: Your Submissions can NOT be commercially released on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., OR be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive), including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc. Distribution agreements are fine. It's publishing, licensing, and publishing administration deals that are the problem.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal. You’ll split all upfront sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright. Since this is an EXCLUSIVE deal, please be sure the material you submit for this pitch is not already signed with other Libraries or Catalogs. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Sunday, April 28th, 2024. TAXI # S240428ZR",

			"request_description": "Lots of NATURE DOCUMENTARY INSTRUMENTAL CUES are needed by a Brand New Music Licensing Company started by a seasoned industry pro! They already have distribution for their catalog, and because it's a new company this is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor and build a new relationship with an awesome, new Music Library!\n\nThis Company is looking for Instrumental Cues in the general ballpark of these references we got directly from them:\n\n\"Grand Canyon Suite: III. On the Trail\" by New York Philharmonic Orchestra (from 3:48 - 4:50)\n\nYellowstone - The Breathtaking Beauty of America's First National Park (from 45:39 - 46:23)\n\n\"Great Smoky Mountains: A Fairytale World from Once Upon A Time\" - Wildlife Documentary (from 16:29 - 17:03)\n\nQUOTING THE COMPANY'S CEO: \"This needs to be a film score style of writing. Instrumentation should be mainly an orchestral palette but can contain electronic instruments if they blend well with the orchestra. The goal is to evoke an emotion that is representative of nature settings: mountains, plains, forests, deserts, etc. Stick to a singular emotion which can be dramatic, optimistic, despair, etc.\"\n\nPlease submit Orchestral-based Instrumental Cues that evoke a singular emotion and could work to elevate a nature documentary. Emotionally captivating motifs, solid compositions, and dynamic arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest are needed for this request. Instrumentation that's in the general stylistic ballpark of the references will work best (think strings, percussion, winds, brass, etc). Please be sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and very realistic-sounding. Also note that the company's CEO said, \"...can contain electronic instruments if they blend well with the orchestra.\"\n\nTAXI TIP: It may be helpful to use muted nature documentaries for visual inspiration while composing for this opportunity. (In fact, the Client even suggested it!)\n\nYour submissions should be between 2 and 4 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, buttoned/stinger endings will work best. Do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use it only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. Sync fees will be split 50/50. The Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Instrumental Cues as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Thursday, May 9th, 2024. TAXI # S240509DU",

See below.\n\nThis awesome publisher is looking for Songs that are in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Di-gue-ding-ding\" by Michel Legrand\n\n\"Notte di mezza estate\" by Piero Umiliani\n\n\"Bim Bom\" by Astrud Gilberto\n\nBroadcast Quality should be era-appropriate. You can submit old masters — or even well-recorded/produced demos — for this request.\n\nPlease submit original, Jazz-inspired Songs (recorded before the year 2000) with a fun, kitschy vibe! Light-hearted melodies, fun motifs, engaging rhythms, and solid arrangements are all needed for this opportunity. Instrumentation that's in the general ballpark of the references will work best here (think guitars, strings, drums, percussion, etc).  Nonsensical lyrics or \"vocalese\" performances will work best here!\n\nPlease make sure your Songs were actually recorded before 2000 (give or take a couple of years), otherwise this company cannot use them! They DO NOT want material that was recently recorded and made to sound old. They can only use AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL, VINTAGE RECORDINGS, and only if the sound quality is reasonably good. This is a golden opportunity to make money with music you might have thought had no hope in today’s market!\n\nThe Company pays you upfront for the Master Rights and the Publisher’s share of the Copyright. You keep the Writer’s Share and earn income from performance royalties paid by your Performing Rights Organization. This Company often averages several placements per week, and many of those are TAXI members who’ve been signed with them because they submitted to a listing like this! Dozens of TAXI members have signed buyout deals with this company. Several have even received upfront checks for $10,000 to $15,000 (or more!). Deal sizes and buyout amounts vary depending on the quantity and quality of the Songs signed.\n\nYour name needs to be on the Copyright. Your Songs need to be original compositions (no covers), and you need to own or control the Copyright and Master recording to submit for this pitch. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. Please include lyrics. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Saturday, May 11th, 2024. TAXI # S240511VC",

Similar tempo, style, and overall vibe? Yes. Clones?

Catchy melodies, meaningful hooks, solid arrangements, driving rhythms, and expressive, well-performed vocals are all needed for this request. Pop/Rock instrumentation in the general wheelhouse of the reference will suit your submissions best. (think piano, acoustic drums, bass, guitars, etc) Please ensure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and realistic-sounding.\n\nLyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity could make your Songs easier to place. Please do NOT copy the referenced artist or song in any way, shape, or form.

No publishing splits.\n\nThis Film's Producer is looking for Songs with Male vocals that could work as a replacement for \"Waiting Room\" by Fugazi, which is currently temped in:\n\n\"Waiting Room\" by Fugazi\n\nThey're NOT looking for clones or soundalikes! Similar tempo, style, and overall vibe? Yes. Clones? No!\n\nIMPORTANT: Because the scene is already edited, matching (or being close to) the tempo of the reference is strongly recommended.\n\nPlease submit high-intensity Punk Rock Songs with a sound reminiscent of the late '80s! Your submissions should have memorable melodies, pounding rhythms, intense hooks, solid arrangements, distorted guitars, and well-crafted lyrics. '80s Punk Rock instrumentation that's in the general wheelhouse of the reference Song will work best for this opportunity (think electric guitars, bass, drums, etc.). Please ensure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality. Well-performed and expressive Male vocals delivered with intensity are needed.\n\nLyrics should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity. Please do NOT copy the referenced artist or song in any way, shape, or form. Use it as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThe license fee for this placement is (up to) $150, depending on the ultimate use. This is a Direct-to-Film Producer placement, so you’ll keep 100% ownership of your Copyright and Master Recordings, plus you’ll also get 100% of the License Fee and any applicable performance royalties. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recordings to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.  Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Thursday, May 2nd, 2024. TAXI # S240502GZ",

Listener discretion is advised.\n\nDUCKWRTH - POWER POWER\n\nRun It - DJ Snake -  (ft. Rick Ross & Rich Brian)\n\nRun The Jewels - Blockbuster Night Part 1\n\nStart to Finish - Slizzy McGuire\n\nQuoting the Company's CEO: \"These Songs need to be high energy, fast-paced, and sports/promo-friendly. Dynamic and detailed production is key, coupled with powerful vocal and lyrical performances.\"\n\nPlease submit well-produced Hip-Hop Songs full of epic, hard-hitting energy that could work well for a variety of placements in Film and TV. Your submissions should have hard-hitting beats and rhythms, loads of energy and intensity, memorable hooks, slick lyrical flows, solid arrangements, and powerful, well-crafted lyrics. Vocal performances need to be raw, unapologetic and well-performed. Instrumentation can vary based on your approach, but a hybrid approach to Hip-Hop in the general stylistic ballpark of the references will work best (think synths, sound design, cinematic drums, brass stabs, etc.). Please be sure your production is dynamic, detailed, and modern. Any virtual sounds or samples you use should be high-quality and not dated-sounding.\n\nLyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity are strongly recommended. Non-faded, Buttoned/Stinger endings are needed for this request. Do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This Library will need 30-second and 60-second versions of your Songs AS WELL AS stems, but not yet! All you need to submit for now are the Full Songs, but please have 30-second and 60-second versions, AND stems on hand, and ready-to-go. Please read the next paragraph carefully...\n\nCritical FYI: The 30-second and 60-second versions are likely to be used for advertising, so they actually need to end at :29.5 seconds and :59.5 seconds, including reverb tails and instrument ring outs. TV and radio stations use computers to switch from one thing to another on VERY precise schedules, so if your reverb tails or instrument ring outs exceed :29.5 seconds and/or :59.5 seconds, your music will not work, and cannot be used.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. If you've checked the box to have your music \"monetized,\" published, or administrated by a company like CDBaby, TuneCore, or SongTrust, you CAN NOT submit for this request. They are fine companies, and if you're only using them to distribute your music, no problem. But, if you checked that box, you've already got a publisher or a company administrating your publishing, which means that you cannot sign that music to another publisher!\n\nThis Music Library will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recording to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD.

Use it as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Era-appropriate Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThe license fee for this placement is (up to) $150, depending on the ultimate use. This is a Direct-to-Producer placement, so you’ll keep 100% ownership of your Copyright and Master Recordings, plus you’ll also get 100% of the License Fee and any applicable performance royalties. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recordings to pitch for this opportunity.

Early Rock guitar tones, throwback drum grooves, trippy motifs, memorable melodies, solid arrangements, catchy choruses, and well-crafted lyrics are all needed.

Your productions need to sound authentically '60s, and please be sure your vocal performances are compelling and well-performed!\n\nPlease be sure not to go overboard with the psychedelic aspect. Anything that is too abstract or that veers off into experimental territory won't work here.\n\nLyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, brands, places, and profanity could make your Songs more appealing for sync placements. Do NOT copy the referenced artists or songs in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for texture, tone, and overall vibe.

Your submissions should have super catchy hooks, tons of mainstream/commercial appeal, memorable melodies, engaging rhythms, and well-crafted lyrics. Modern Pop/Rock instrumentation that's in the general wheelhouse of the references will work best. Please make sure your productions and any virtual instruments or samples you use are high quality and not dated-sounding. Compelling, expressive, and well-performed vocals are key for this pitch. If you have Songs that could be the next crossover Pop/Rock hit, send them in!\n\nIMPORTANT: This Executive is interested in artists and bands that have gained some traction from actively working on their careers. Please detail (in your bio) what you are doing with your career. Include any impressive touring, fan base, sales, streaming, or social media figures. That said – if you’re a new artist or band just starting out and don’t have much of a story or track record, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Songs to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nTAXI Tip: We recommend submitting at least 2 Songs per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for texture and tone.\n\nPlease submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include lyrics, photos, and a bio. All submissions will be screened by a TAXI A&R Team Member who has a strong relationship with the Executive.

No publishing splits.\n\nThis Film's Producer is on the hunt for Down-Tempo Songs that could work as a replacement for \"I'm Giving In\" by Matt Andersen, which is currently temped in:\n\n\"I'm Giving In\" by Matt Andersen\n\nThey're NOT looking for clones or soundalikes! Similar tempo, style, and overall vibe? Yes. Clones? No!\n\nQUOTING THE FILM'S PRODUCER: \"In this graveyard scene, the lead character's father has passed away and she must decide to do something with her life. It needs an emotional, piano-driven feel.\"\n\nTempo Matters: Because the scene is already edited, matching (or being close to) the tempo of the reference is strongly recommended.\n\nPlease submit Down-Tempo Ballads with a captivating, emotionally charged sound that draws the listener in from start to finish. Impactful melodies, solid arrangements, and expressive, well-performed vocals are all needed for this request. Instrumentation should primarily feature piano, but some very subtle additional accompaniment could also possibly work (think very light strings, etc.). Please ensure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality, realistic, and not dated-sounding. Genuine, heartfelt vocal performances full of emotion could help you seal the deal!\n\nLyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity could make your Songs easier to place. Please do NOT copy the referenced artist or song in any way, shape, or form. Use it as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThe license fee for this placement is (up to) $1,000, depending on the ultimate use. This is a Direct-to-Film Producer placement, so you’ll keep 100% ownership of your Copyright and Master Recordings, you’ll also get 100% of the License Fee and any applicable performance royalties. You must own or control your Copyright and Master Recordings to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Thursday, April 25th, 2024. TAXI # S240425GV",

			"request_description": "Seeking Hits for Licensing PlacementsWe have been working tirelessly over the years to build the best catalog of great independent music from various genres. However, there is one area in which we feel we could do better. Therefor, we are seeking Pop music to represent for licensing in films, TV shows and ad campaigns. By “Pop” we are referring more to the broad appeal of the music than the genre. As long as the song has hit potential, we would like to hear it. Genre wise we are open, but indie pop and indie folk seem to work best for licensing placements. \n\nHere are some great examples of music that we would like to have in our catalog: \n\n- The Lumineers - Ho Hey\n- Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home\n- Charli XCX - Break The Rules\n- James Bay - Hold Back The River\n\nWe accept ONE-STOP submissions only, ie songs that you own or control 100% (writer, master and publisher). Please submit only professionally recorded and mastered songs. NO DEMOS, NO COVERS.\n\nAs an added bonus, if your song is Selected, we will offer to release your music on Filter Label. The songs by our talented artists can be heard in The OA, Exatlon, The Matrix Revisited, CSI: Las Vegas, Nikita, on ads for McDonald's, Nestle Wagner, Nike, Philip Morris, Hachette Filipacchi, in shows on MTV, CNN, Bravo, Nat Geo, NBC, Esquire, Channel 4 and almost every major TV network in the world.- Emil Hadji -Panzov Founder / CEO - Filter Label",

Ie, Drum & Bass, Hip-Hop, Dubstep, Electronica, Edm, Trap, Grime, Experimental etc. \n  \nAll tracks must be upbeat and have a “Phat Beat”, “Killer Beat”, “Sick Beats”, “Dope Beat” or whatever your preferred description would be. \n   \nMusic must be well produced, high-quality, mixed and mastered. Instrumental tracks preferred please, but great vocal tracks can be accepted too (if you can supply instrumental versions even better) and all tempos considered. \n  \nArtists must own all rights to their music 100% on both sides and there must be no copyright infringement. All music will be listened to, reviewed and feedback given.  \n  \nThe average cost of TV advertising commercial in Korea is $800 to $1,500 per track, and for worldwide rights up to $14,000. \n   \nThe average cost of Online & YouTube advertising in Korea is $500-$2500 (geo restricted for single country of Korea), and worldwide use for $3000-$5000.  \n  \nSelected tracks be sent to clients in South Korea and music licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), we simply go 50-50 on deals we get and you're paid quarterly.   \n \nThe South Korean market is built on a unique structure, which is not the same as any foreign market structure around the world. Because of this Korea has a higher advertising music fee than most other countries. This may be due to systemic limitations that the performing royalties cannot be collected, but also because there is no subsequent secondary payment after the initial payment of music fees. The total amount paid in Korea is 100% mechanical payout. \n  \nClients who will be using music in South Korea; Korea's major advertising agencies including the CHEIL and INOCEAN and brands such as; Samsung, LG, Hyundai and SK to name a few. \n  \nIf you make “beats’ I really look forward to hearing from you ! \n  \nAll the best,  \n- Giles Gale -\nMusic supervisor, sync & Licensing Manager - Resonant Music Licensing",

				"The journey through grief after losing a loved one. Verses narrate the initial shock and emptiness, while the chorus reflects on memories and acceptance, capturing both sorrow and love that survives loss. The bridge symbolizes a moment of turning, where the protagonist finds a way to carry forward the legacy of the loved one, embracing life again with a hope that acknowledges the pain.",
				"The end of a long-term relationship where the protagonist details how every space and season now echoes with the absence of the partner. Through the lyrics, they address direct feelings of loss and the unfulfilled dreams they had together, while gradually coming to terms with reality, and finding a gentle closure and personal growth by the song's conclusion.",
				"A narrative about letting go of youthful dreams as reality sets in, using metaphors of seasons changing and landscapes transforming. It captures the melancholic realization of lost opportunities and the maturity one gains. The song transitions from a tone of despair to one of acceptance and newfound peace, ultimately suggesting that every end paves the way for new beginnings."

				"\"Climb Your Mountain\" — The song focuses on an individual facing seemingly insurmountable challenges but continues to strive towards their peak. Each verse builds on the struggle, interwoven with imagery of rocky terrain and stormy weather, symbolizing the obstacles in life. The chorus rings out with a powerful, catchy melody, urging listeners to \"climb your mountain, reach the sky,\" encapsulating the passion and determination required to chase dreams.",
				"\"Light of Dawn\" — This track tells the story of a protagonist who starts off lost in the dark, metaphorically speaking, unable to find their path. As the song progresses, it details their journey of self-discovery and perseverance despite the hardships. The chorus celebrates the breakthrough moment with a thrilling, motivational beat and lyrics like, \"Chase the light of dawn, through the fight, stand strong,\" emphasizing resilience and the joy of pursuing passions.",
				"\"Break the Chains\" — Here, the lyrics delve into the theme of breaking free from the constraints that hold one back, whether they be fear, doubt, or societal expectations. Verses narrate personal stories of overcoming these barriers, while the chorus offers an anthem-like, catchy melody shouting \"Break the chains, take the reins,\" inspiring listeners to take control of their destiny and never give up on their dreams."

			"request_description": "Seeking Covers of Hit Songs for Licensing PlacementsThe post houses and advertising agencies we work with seem to have a never ending demand for covers of popular songs. Therefor, we would like to broaden our catalog with inventive cover versions of compositions that have been big worldwide hits.\n\nWe are not looking for interpretations trying to imitate the original. We are seeking just the opposite - new takes on well known songs which transport them to new, unexpected directions. Covers are usually considered for film trailers and big ad campaigns, so it would be great to hear submissions that have space and a “cinematic” sound. However, if you have a dynamic, aggressive cover of a slow song, that could work too.\n\n\nBelow are some brilliant examples of what we would like to hear: \n\n- Skylar Grey - Addicted To Love\n- Vega Choir - Creep\n- Lo-Fang - You’re The One That I Want\n- Hannah Peel - Tainted Love\n- Think Up Anger feat. Malia J - Smells Like Teen Spirit\n- Lorde - Everybody Wants To Rule The World\n- KI Theory - Enjoy The Silence\n\nPlease submit only professionally recorded and mastered songs.\n\nAs an added bonus, if your cover is Selected, we will offer to release your music on Filter Label. The songs by our talented artists can be heard in The OA, Exatlon, The Matrix Revisited, CSI: Las Vegas, Nikita, on ads for McDonald's, Nike, Philip Morris, Nestle Wagner, Bank Millennium, in shows on MTV, CNN, Nat Geo, NBC, Al Jazeera, Esquire, Channel 4 and almost every major TV network in the world.- Emil Hadji Panzov Founder / CEO - Filter Label",

This ties into DIRECTION 1 by reflecting the heist-like suspense and fun.",

The verse builds with challenges and tensions faced, leading to a powerful, liberating chorus that celebrates breaking through barriers and achieving dreams, aligning well with both DIRECTION 2’s modern, driving musical styles and the overall theme of achieving success despite hardships.",
				"The lyrics portrays a journey through a vibrant cityscape at night, capturing the essence of a thrilling drive filled with twists and turns, highs and lows. Each verse reveals more about the personal growth and realizations of the driver, representing the story of navigating through life’s unexpected moments. This would match the dynamic and slightly quirky production style desired, fitting well into either of the musical directions provided."

They have asked for intense and dramatic songs, positive songs, friendship songs, and holiday and travel themed songs. Once again they are choosing different songs for different territories so there are many slots they are looking for me to fill.\n\nThe videos and ads will be seen by over a million people across the globe.\n\nAll styles of music and genres will be considered as the company are looking top quality songs but also lyrical substance and they are also looking for top quality standout attention-grabbing, meaningful songs whether softer emotive ballads or harder more powerful driving tracks as the range covered by the company is huge.\n\nTHEY JUST NEED BE TOP SONGS!!\n\nPlease submit your best work, radio ready, mastered songs. You must own 100% copyright. Only songs with cleared samples. I will accept demos as I am also a music producer / studio owner so if the song is a 'no brainer' and has enough potential to fit the opp then I would consider re-cutting it for the client.\n\nGrand Northern Sync has worked closely with companies such as: Apple, Honda, Reebok, Samsung, BBC, ABC, New Show Media, Massive Films, Rickety Shack films, Seat, H&M, Busch,\n\nPayouts and rights: If selected you will keep 100% of your rights, royalties and payments dependent on the number of times the tracks are used. Payout is $25k dependent on usage and length of use.\n\nIf selected the songs will be passed to the company and they will have the final say, Grand Northern Sync will be on hand to help the artist all the way through the process with chosen artists (at no financial charge).\n\nAll songs submitted will be considered for all the other opps we have.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing your music.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT SEND US TRACKS TO OUR SOUNDCLOUD, EMAIL, LINKEDIN OR ANY SOCIAL MEDIA....Please?\n\n- Alexander Johnston / Grand Northern Sync",

The song ends on a reflective note, recognizing that the journey of chasing dreams is perpetual and ever-evolving."

				"**Empowering Journey**: The song tells the story of a woman who overcomes numerous personal and professional obstacles, finally reaching her peak. The verses explore her struggles and doubts, while the chorus celebrates her resilience and success with an uplifting, anthemic melody. Lines like, \"Climbed every mountain, faced the dark, I’m standing strong, I've left my mark,\" encapsulate her triumphant journey.",
				"**Rise After the Fall**: This song captures the essence of a dramatic comeback. The lyrics describe a period of sudden downfall and contemplation, followed by a powerful resurgence. “Fell from the heights, hit the ground, now watch me rise, unstoppable sound,” would be an example of how the verses transition into a chorus that's both defiant and inspiring, aligning perfectly with the theme of overcoming adversity.",
				"**Reflections on Past Struggles**: The song introspectively examines the sacrifices made on the road to success. Starting with softer, slower verses reflecting on past challenges, the beat builds to an energetic, powerful chorus that celebrates present achievements. Lyrics like, \"Silent battles, quiet strength, I’ve paid the dues, I claim my stakes,\" would effectively convey the journey from struggle to victory."

Country songsLabel/Publisher is seeking songs for release, publishing, sync placement opportunities, and promotion. We have a proven record of placing songs with major networks and brands such as FOX, ABC, Roxy, Forever 21, Specialized, etc. \n\nWe are specifically seeking music from artists that have a timeless sound. The overall vibe of the label is one of honest music with warm vintage emotion. We are looking for Singer-Songwriter, Folk, Americana, Alt. Country that evokes emotion. We lean toward a more melancholy sound so please no “fun” or overly “happy” songs. At the moment we are only seeking single songs. By focusing on singles we can target specific markets when promoting and seeking sync placements. This also allows us to craft the labels’ “sound” while acting as a discovery vehicle for new and emerging artists. \n\nIMPORTANT: Artists must be willing to sign the master & publishing rights to the selected song over to the label and publisher. The songwriter/writers will retain 100% of the writing credit and will receive all royalties for their share. In addition, an advance will be paid to the writer/performer for the song in an amount to be determined. The advance then becomes a recoupable expense. After the advance is recouped, all income generated by the song will be split 50/50. \n\nOur label is distributed by our digital aggregator, The Orchard, and releases will be available on every major retailer and streaming service including iTunes, Spotify, IHeartRadio, Amazon, YouTube, Google Music, rDio, Shazam, Flipagram, etc. - Jason Currie / Dog Bites Wolf\nDeal Type: Catalog Inclusion\nDecision Maker: We are the final decision maker\nDeal Structure: Exclusive\nCompensation: $251 - $500\nSong Quality: Rough Mixes, Fully mastered, Broadcast ready\nSimilar Sounding Artists: Nikki Lane, William Fitzsimmons, Jason Isbell, Lykke Li, Iron & Wine, Sturgill Simpson, Margo Price",

				"The lyrics describe a vibrant, unforgettable night out where everyone is dancing, the music is loud, and the atmosphere pulsates with energy, capturing the essence of the 80s club scene. Throughout the song, the lyrics convey the fun and carefree spirit of partying, with vivid imagery of disco balls, neon lights, and wild dance moves. As the night fades into dawn, the song transitions to themes of returning to daily responsibilities, highlighting the contrast between the nightlife fantasy and daytime reality.",
				"The song's lyrics follow a group of friends as they embark on a spontaneous road trip to a legendary 80s-themed music festival. It starts with high-energy descriptions of setting off with no particular plan, the car radio blasting iconic 80s hits, and the windows down. As they revel in nostalgia and the freedom of youth, the chorus captures the euphoria of living in the moment. The final verses reflect on the fleeting nature of these experiences, bringing an emotional depth as they contemplate the end of their journey and the return to their routine lives.",
				"The lyrics depict an epic end-of-summer party set in the 1980s, filled with classic 80s fashion, games, and references. The song starts with the anticipation of the party, capturing the excitement and energy of getting ready and heading out. As the party peaks, the lyrics explore themes of making memories, letting loose, and enjoying youth. The final verses then introduce a reflective mood, contemplating how such moments are precious and rare, with a hint of melancholy as the night winds down and the reality of life's responsibilities looms."

				"**\"Rise Again\"**: The lyrics narrate the tale of a underdog who faces numerous hardships in both personal and professional life. The beginning verses depict scenes of despair and frustration where the protagonist is almost defeated by challenges. As the song progresses, the chorus transitions into a powerful, uplifting melody, symbolizing hope and resurgence, culminating in the character's inevitable victory over adversity.",
				"**\"Overcome\"**: This song describes the journey of an individual battling through a dark phase, symbolized by a slow and melancholic introduction. The verses detail the struggles and mental battles faced, painting a vivid picture of their internal and external conflicts. The bridge introduces a shift, gradually building up to a triumphant finale, where the music and lyrics celebrate the protagonist’s resilience and eventual triumph.",
				"**\"From Shadows to Sunlight\"**: The lyrics follow a narrative arc of a person who begins in a place of darkness and defeat, illustrated through melancholic melodies and slow tempo. The narrative evolves with the person facing life’s obstacles, slowly gathering strength, depicted by gradual changes in the musical pace. The final act of the song showcases a dramatic, victorious conclusion where the person steps into the metaphorical sunlight, having conquered their erstwhile insurmountable hurdles."

				"The lyrics are about a carefree adventurer who leaves behind the stresses of daily life to revel in the sun-soaked landscapes of a tropical paradise. The chorus captures the bliss of lying on the beach, sipping cool drinks, and letting all worries slip away. However, as the song progresses, it explores the temporary nature of this escape and the eventual return to reality, reflecting on the rejuvenation this break provides and the strength to face routine challenges anew.",
				"The song tells the story of a group of friends who embark on a summer road trip, driving down coastal roads with the windows down and music blaring. The lyrics describe the landscapes passing by, the laughter shared, and the sense of freedom that comes with an endless summer. The bridge might hint at the realization that these moments are fleeting, and the need to eventually return to personal responsibilities, but celebrates the memories made.",
				"The track focuses on a protagonist who daydreams about escaping to an idyllic island to break away from the pressures of urban life. The verses vividly paint the serene settings of the island life, the calm sea, and the laid-back atmosphere, crafting an immersive sensory experience. As the song concludes, the protagonist snaps back to the city's hustle but carries the calmness and perspective gained from the imagined getaway, preparing them to tackle life's complexities with a fresh mindset."

				"A vibrant and rhythmic Brazilian samba or bossa nova tune that tells the story of a dreamer who embarks on a journey filled with challenges. Each verse could depict different stages of facing doubts and obstacles, with choruses that burst with motivating lyrics about persisting and embracing the arduous path to success. The bridge can highlight a moment of introspection before the final chorus triumphantly celebrates the joy of continual pursuit, mirroring the never-ending journey towards achieving one's dreams.",
				"This song could incorporate elements of Afoxé and Maracatu, utilizing their traditional rhythms to symbolize the flow and onslaught of life's trials. The lyrics can narrate the story of a young person growing up by the riverside, learning to navigate the currents of life, akin to controlling a boat in the choppy waters. Each verse could introduce a new challenge while the chorus reinforces the idea of rising after each fall, driven by a melody that’s both uplifting and inspiring, urging listeners to never stop chasing their dreams regardless of the hurdles.",
				"Leveraging the powerful energy of Brazilian Metal or Rock, this track could center around the theme of battling through societal and personal barriers to reach one's dreams. Verses could chronicle conflicts and moments of self-doubt, with a thunderous chorus that uses the metaphor of an echo in a canyon—how every action echoes back and builds towards achieving one's goals. The song could end on a note that celebrates every small victory on the path to fulfillment, with lyrics that encourage resilience and determination."

The chorus emphasizes perseverance and the belief in oneself, despite the stones thrown by life and rivals. Lyrics highlight the gritty, sweaty training sessions and the climactic moment of victory that justifies the hard work, mirroring themes from \"Cobra Kai.\"",
				"Set to rousing 80s rock-style music, the song evokes nostalgia while stirring motivation. It speaks about rekindling an old rivalry that pushes both characters to newer and greater heights. The lyrics play on dualities—past versus present, youth versus experience—culminating in a powerful chorus that rallies listeners to never see any challenge as too big to overcome.",
				"This track focuses on togetherness and teamwork, featuring an ensemble-like chorus that could mimic a group chant from a dojo. It emphasizes collaboration over competition, aligning with scenes in \"Cobra Kai\" where characters learn to find common ground. Verses highlight individual stories of overcoming personal obstacles leading to a unifying bridge, driving home the message that together, every hurdle can be surpassed."

The bridge reflects a moment of introspection about the personal sacrifices made to achieve their dreams, before returning to an energizing finale that reaffirms their new-found status.",

				"This track uses a metaphorical climb to symbolize the artist’s career progression, detailing the challenges encountered along the way. The lyrics describe the constant push to evolve, defy expectations, and break barriers. Engaging hooks emphasize empowerment and victory against odds. A sudden drop in the middle allows for a brief, reflective pause on past struggles, insinuating that each setback was a lesson leading to eventual success.",
				"**Echoes of Victory**",
				"The lyrics center around the theme of legacy and making one’s mark in the world despite numerous setbacks. Verses detail the struggle and resilience required to stand out, while the chorus boasts of triumph and the echo it leaves behind. A dramatic fall in the energy during the bridge provides a contemplative moment, pondering the cost of success and the personal transformation involved, ending with a powerful final chorus that resonates with victory and fulfillment."

(Identity undisclosed)\n\nCreative Details from Client\n\n \n\nProject Overview:\n\nDevelop a captivating campaign for the secret Boutique Whiskey, set to launch this year. The campaign emphasizes fearless creativity, aiming to resonate with audiences through compelling storytelling.\n\nMusic Requirement:\n\nThe selected track should exude an indie rock vibe akin to \"Welcome to my Island,\" featuring a strong beat and uplifting vocals. The overall tone should channel the spirit of artists like Karen O and Caroline, with a distinct \"left of the dial\" appeal. The lyrics must strike a balance between relevance and neutrality, avoiding overly celebratory or melancholic themes. The emphasis lies on impactful vocals and a dynamic progression that complements the video narrative.\n\nClient Preferences:\n\nPreferably vocals-driven, with lyrics that resonate without veering into clichéd or overly empowering territory. The song should possess a certain edge while maintaining a universal appeal.\n\n\nExclusivity and Usage:\n\nExclusivity is granted to similar brands within the whiskey industry. The global campaign spans across various mediums, including social media, CTV/digital platforms (limited to the US and UK), and Out-of-Home advertising. Usage rights extend for one year across all channels, with paid media usage restricted to six months in the US, UK, and Sweden.\n\nBudget:\n\nTotal budget allocation stands at $30,000 All-In (Less all Fees), covering all aspects of music acquisition and licensing.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nCreativity and relevance are paramount in song selection, aligning closely with the brand's ethos and the campaign's overarching theme of fearless innovation.\n\nPlease include lyrics, Composer (PRO/IPI)\n\nBroadcast Quality is needed.\n\nYou must own or control your Master and Copyright to pitch for this opportunity. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by our MMG team for quality purposes, then moved forward. If they decide to move forward we will contact you immediately. If you don't hear back within a week of the deadline then you can consider it a pass.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\nDeadline: Midnight April 26, 2024,",

				"The lyrics is about a musician's journey from playing in small clubs to achieving global fame. Throughout the song, the beat intensifies as the musician celebrates milestone victories, like landing a big deal or hearing their song on the radio for the first time. In contrast, during a quieter bridge, the lyrics reflect on the loneliness and hard decisions faced along the way, ultimately reaffirming their passion and dedication to their craft.",
				"The lyrics depicts an athlete's hard road to success, paralleling a competitive race. Initially, the music is driven and intense, mirroring the athlete’s rigorous training and determination. Each chorus celebrates crossing a metaphorical finish line, capturing moments of triumph. The song’s bridge reduces intensity, contemplating past injuries and personal sacrifices, before surging back to an empowered, celebratory finale.",
				"The lyrics tells the story of a startup entrepreneur's rise to success, with ascending beats that mirror the growth of their business and the excitement of innovation. Key moments in the song highlight big achievements and breakthroughs, matched with an energetic and victorious chorus. However, during a softer interlude, the lyrics ponder the toll of long work hours and personal sacrifices, before ending on a note of triumph and resilience."

				"The lyrics are about reflecting on simple joys and childhood dreams, using imagery of old, dusty roads leading back to one's hometown where dreams began. Each verse brings more insight into how these modest beginnings foster hope and resilience, eventually leading to a fulfilling return to those dreams with a new perspective and appreciation.",
				"The lyrics depict the story of an individual working through daily routines and challenges but finding moments of beauty and inspiration in small, unexpected joys. The chorus emphasizes lifting one's eyes from the grind to the skies, symbolizing the pursuit of dreams and the belief that anything is possible with perseverance and optimism.",
				"The lyrics narrate the journey of overcoming life's hurdles, using metaphors of sailing through stormy seas towards sunny horizons. The song stresses the infinite nature of chasing dreams, where each milestone achieved leads to the discovery of new horizons. The uplifting melody underscores the message that the pursuit itself brings joy and meaning to life, encouraging listeners to keep striving for their personal best."

The season leaves the audience on the edge, and we need a track that will highlight the mystery and thrill of what’s to come. Tonally, it should sound modern and exciting, something with a moody and darker feel to it. A track that builds from a soft introduction into a bass heavy, percussive chorus would tick all boxes. While lyrics requirements are open, the track should convey power and confidence. \n\nGood Luck \n\nMuch Love\nAlex\nGrand Northern Sync",

				"The song captures the journey of an artist starting from obscurity and climbing towards their dreams. Using the metaphor of ascending a mountain, the lyrics detail the hardships, the setbacks, and victories experienced along the way. The chorus emphasizes perseverance and the joy found in the climb, echoing the notion that the pursuit of dreams is a continual, rewarding process.",
				"This song encourages listeners to ignite the passion within and forge their own paths. Verses narrate stories of different individuals who face doubts and discouragement but choose to light their path with determination and hard work. The uplifting and motivating melody, coupled with a powerful chorus, reaffirms the message that following one’s dreams, despite challenges, is the way to true fulfillment.",
				"Inspired by the vast, endless universe, this song metaphorically compares chasing one's dreams to a journey across the cosmos. Each verse explores different stages of this quest—leaving comfort zones, navigating through obstacles, and finally achieving the seemingly impossible. The song concludes on a reflective note, suggesting that every achievement is a starting point for another dream, and the journey is indeed never-ending."

				"Centered around an individual who, after years of feeling directionless, discovers their true passion and starts pursuing it against all odds. The song details moments of self-doubt and external criticism but culminates in a powerful bridge that shifts to a major key, symbolizing the breakthrough and joy of following one's true calling.",
				"Tells the story of an underdog sports team or player who has always been overlooked. The lyrics parallel their journey with a deeper message of chasing dreams regardless of the odds.

				"The lyrics is about a small-town singer who dreams of making it big in Nashville, overcoming challenges and setbacks along the way. As the song progresses, it builds up the excitement of finally getting noticed after playing in local bars and small venues. The climax of the song reaches as the singer gets a call from Universal Music Group Nashville, offering them a spot on their roster. The energy then drops as the artist reflects on the long nights and sacrifices made, appreciating the journey to stardom.",
				"The song tells the story of a farmer's daughter who leaves her small rural life behind pursuing a music career, battling doubts and the fear of failure. The narrative builds as she gains confidence and strength, proving doubters wrong with each performance. Eventually, she lands a major break through her unique blend of traditional and modern country sounds, which reflects the kind of music Universal Music Group Nashville seeks. The bridge captures a poignant moment where she looks back at her humble beginnings, recognizing the immense effort and emotional toll it took to reach her dreams.",
				"The lyrics describe a seasoned musician reflecting on their long career, from playing in dive bars to large arenas. The song details the highs of performing on stage and the lows of the music industry, building intensity with each verse as the musician's fame grows. The turning point comes when the musician contemplates retirement, realizing the true cost of their success — personal sacrifices and lost loves. The song concludes with a powerful, reflective chorus about being grateful for the journey and continuing to inspire upcoming artists."

				"This song traces the journey of a small-town individual with big dreams. The lyrics explore the early mornings and late nights spent honing their craft, facing rejections and self-doubt, but remaining steadfast in their pursuit. The chorus is a powerful, uplifting reminder to keep pushing forward, emphasizing that every hard-earned step is a leap closer to their dreams.",
				"This track tells a story of a person overcoming various obstacles in life, using the metaphor of a traveler crossing hills and valleys to reach their destination. Each verse confronts a different challenge—personal loss, financial hardship, self-discovery—while the chorus provides a hopeful refrain about persistence and ultimate success.",
				"An anthem for all who dare to dream big, this song showcases a parade of individuals from various backgrounds, each with their own unique dreams and challenges. The lyrics deliver a message of unity and encouragement, reminding listeners that while everyone's journey is different, they are not alone in their struggles. The bridge offers a moment of introspection before culminating in a celebratory, motivational chorus that invites everyone to join in the dreamers' parade."

				"\"Outlaw's Freedom\" - lyrics describe a character who defies conventional societal norms, living life on the edge with fast cars and loud guitars. Each verse builds on the character's daring escapades, leading to a bridge that reflects on the consequences of such a rebellious lifestyle, ultimately questioning whether the freedom is worth the price.",
				"\"Breaking Chains\" - this song captures the spirit of breaking free from societal shackles. It starts with a powerful, edgy guitar riff and speaks to a journey of self-discovery and defiance against societal expectations. The chorus is catchy and empowering, while the final verse introspectively considers the isolation and misunderstandings that can accompany such rebellion.",
				"\"Ride the Storm\" - the song tells the tale of a person who challenges every norm and rule, depicted as riding through life like a storm. The lyrics portray thrilling adventures and chaos embraced with open arms, backed by an edgy musical composition. The closing lines bring a sobering reminder of the impact and aftermath of living a life without boundaries."

Instrumental music preferred please, but great vocals welcome (but please make sure you can supply instrumental version as well) and all tempos, required.  \n\nAdditionally, covers of old classics such as Silent Night which are copyright free would be great too!\n\nArtists must own all rights to their music 100% and there must be no copyright infringement.  \n\nSelected tracks will be pro-actively pitched to our clients for relevant sync opportunities for use in their Christmas campaigns. Clients are film & video production companies, advertising agencies and a few game developers that make high-end content. \n\nMusic used by clients will be licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), simply go 50-50 on deals we get for you, you’re paid quarterly and keep 100% of all royalties generated from placements. Artist's will receive between £100-£10,000 per use depending on use, type of project etc, so, if you have any great Christmas music for sync, I’d really love to hear from you! \n\nNB; If you have already submitted and had music accepted into our catalogue that is suitable for this brief, you don’t need to re-submit as your music will automatically be pitched to our clients. Thanks! \n\nLooking forward to hearing and working with you :) \n \nAll the best, \nGiles Gale \nMusic Supervisor",

				"The lyrics is about a daring midnight escapade that showcases a person throwing caution to the wind, set to a heavy, gritty guitar riff that conveys a sense of urgency and rebellion. The words evoke images of speeding through city streets, defying norms and escaping the mundane, embodying the thrill and allure of living in the moment.",
				"The lyrics celebrate the story of an outsider who challenges the status quo with a fierce independence. It captures their journey, characterized by bold, confrontational stances against societal expectations, and culminates in a powerful realization of the individual's impact on the world. The soundtrack complements this narrative with raw, intense rock elements that emphasize the theme of defiance.",
				"The lyrics describe a personal revolution where the protagonist decides to break free from societal chains and expectations, exploring themes of self-discovery and autonomy. Set against a backdrop of hard-hitting rock music, the song resonates with anyone who has ever felt suppressed by their circumstances and yearns for freedom. Each verse builds on this idea, climaxing in a chorus that is both anthemic and empowering."

At this time, an average article on our website (similar to what we'd be creating for you) receives an average of 20,000 unique readers who are all looking to discover new and upcoming independent artists. We also have a large and engaged following on all of our social media who are looking for the same.- Austin Sher -\nOwner - We Write About Music",

			"request_description": "Radio Blast: Online stations worldwide\nIt's very simple. We save time and reach more stations than artists could, on their own.\nOur lists cover around 90% of radio station contacts worldwide. For example, in USA, there are aprox. 4,500 online radios and online stations. We have around 4,000 contacts just in The States. Artist sends a radio ready, mixed and mastered song, along with short biography, 4-5 pictures, and logo if possible. We put together a nice looking e-mail, with pure facts about the artist, info on song that's being submitted and artists (or artists management contact information). We believe that it's fair to keep artists direct contact public, so if radio stations want to reach out, they can reach out DIRECTLY to the artist.",

My friend played me a rough demo and wasn't sure about it. I nearly fainted, \"That's Top Ten my friend\" I told him.\n\nI was wrong. It went to Number One in the UK for three weeks!\n\nI hear hits. It's in my DNA. So let me hear what you have and I will give you my brutally honest critique. I will not blow smoke at you. I will tell you what I think and what could be done (if needed) to make it better. \n\nObviously if I love it then I will want to talk business with you too but that is for later.\n\nOK the future is yours for the taking.\n\nMusically yours, Tim H",

This is a continuation of that original musical idea.\n\nIn the past and the present he has been known to play folk, country, rap/hip-hop, punk, classical, power pop and everything in between.  At this point, he's making an effort to include eclectic and original hardcore into the mix to keep his mixed musical explorations on some sort of cutting edge (in his mind if nowhere else....). Once upon a time, he even segued from Carl Perkins into Public Enemy. Yes, his musical tastes are that eclectic, and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as he does. - Michael Perazzetti / Radio Casbah \nDeal Type: Radio Airplay\nWhere is this radio station heard?: Online\nRadio Format: Freeform Radio\nSimilar Sounding Artists: Originals and Public Domain covers only, please",

It then transitions into a reflective moment that acknowledges the sacrifices and hardships endured to achieve success.",

The beat starts bold and powerful, symbolizing the executive’s influence and success, then shifts to softer, introspective tones as it delves into personal struggles and the hidden costs of their high-powered roles.",

The song mirrors the life cycles of triumph and trial, embodying the spirit of those who paved their own paths in the hip-hop and R&B industries."

			"request_description": "Professional Song Critique: Emmy Sound ProductionsI looking forward to hearing your original tunes and to finding the diamonds in the rough! Please submit your song(s) for a critique.\n\nI am looking to both critique artists as well as find new talent. If your music is great I will present it to The SoundBeat for possible distribution. We are always looking for new good talent. Since we are a subsidiary of Sony Music there are endless opportunities for me to present an artist that has real talent.\n\nI believe in developing relationships and making connections. When I work with you I begin by finding out about you, what you like, and where you've been. I learn who your favorite artists are, who inspires you, what entertains you or brings you joy. Always authentic I speak to you on a human level and share freely about lessons and tips I've learned along the way. I've been at The SoundBeat corp for the past 8 years. Before that I worked at Polygram Classics & Jazz, as well as Rolling Stone Magazine. I feel lucky every day that I can work with what I love - music & people - and I don't have to wear a suit!\n\n- Emmy Sound / The Sound Beat (Sound Beat Music Entertainment)",

				"This song captures the journey of a protagonist who faces personal and emotional struggles but eventually finds love and triumph. The track starts with a slow, melancholic melody reflecting the character's initial hardships. The verses delve into the depth of emotional pain and the almost unbearable weight of personal battles. As the chorus approaches, the music gradually builds, symbolizing hope and the potential for change. Ultimately, the track crescendos into an uplifting, powerful chorus where the protagonist celebrates overcoming their adversities through the power of love and resilience.",
				"Focused on the struggle of maintaining a relationship through tough times, this song employs a slower, soulful melody that sets an introspective mood. The lyrics detail the lows of feeling disconnected and the highs of rekindling love. As each verse progresses, the melody and rhythm pick up pace, evolving into a more vibrant and uplifting chorus, reflecting the rejuvenating effect of overcoming personal strife and the joy of triumph in love.",
				"This track explores the theme of perseverance through life's challenges while holding onto love. It starts with a gently sad melody that mirrors the initial feeling of despair faced by the protagonist. The lyrics describe the trials and tribulations encountered in their journey. However, as the song progresses, the music transitions into a robust, victorious anthem, symbolizing triumph over life's obstacles. The chorus reverberates with optimism and success, celebrating the strength found in enduring love and shared battles."

Verses depict specific hardships, like doubts from others and personal setbacks, while the chorus uplifts and inspires with lines about persistence and faith in one's path. The bridge offers a powerful, motivational message that reinforces pursuing dreams relentlessly, supporting the preferred content of chasing dreams and overcoming adversity.",
				"This track features a more upbeat, energetic rhythm, encouraging listeners to \"take flight\" towards their dreams. The lyrics tell a story of self-discovery and growth, highlighting moments of clarity and decision when choosing to chase one's dreams. Each verse adds to the narrative of pushing past fears and societal expectations, culminating in a catchy, repeatable chorus that underlines the joy and fulfillment found in the pursuit of passion, aligning well with the uplifting and motivational melody described in the listing.",
				"Structured as a more reflective, ballad-style song, these lyrics delve into the continuous nature of striving towards goals. The song employs metaphors of roads, journeys, and landscapes to describe the process of chasing dreams. Each verse confronts a different obstacle, whether internal doubts or external pressures, while the repetitive, anthem-like chorus reassures that every step forward on this never-ending road is part of a larger, fulfilling journey. This suits the storyline of ongoing pursuit and realization described in the preferred content."

				"The lyrics delve into the story of a small-town individual who leaves behind humble beginnings to chase ambitious dreams in the big city. The verses highlight struggles and setbacks, while the chorus swells with hopeful tones about perseverance and believing in oneself. The bridge could reflect on their arrival and success, capturing both the joy and the bittersweet nostalgia for simpler times.",
				"The lyrics tell the journey of a born-underdog from a rough, rural area who dreams of making it big in the music industry. Each verse could depict different stages of their life, starting from their modest roots, facing skepticism, and finally achieving success which proves their doubters wrong. The chorus emphasizes themes of grit and hard work, aligning well with the uplifting and motivational aspect preferred for the song.",
				"The lyrics explore the story of an individual working multiple jobs in a small farming community, dreaming of a better life. The narrative outlines their journey towards becoming a successful entrepreneur or artist. The song progresses from minimalistic, acoustic sounds to richer, fuller arrangements, symbolically representing the protagonist's growth and success."

Professional Sound Only! \n\nNetworks such as Sony Pictures, FOX, CBS, NBC Universal, ABC, Lions Gate, Paramount, Warner Bros, etc. We have a \"Huge\" track record of placing music with these entities! We have music in \"King Of Staten Island\", \"Once Upon In Hollywood\",  \"Shape Of Water\" and 1000's of more Major Films and TV Shows!!  Join the Music Of The Sea Revolution!\n\nLook Up Our Credits in the ending credits of these films~!  IMDB!\n\nIf you sign with Music Of The Sea your music will be part of NBC/UNI, CBS Television, Vice, Omnicom system networks upon signing with us. We have deals with these Major Networks. You have a chance to also score shows with us! We have done a ton of custom work!   \n\n\nBecause of the \"High Profile Major Artists\" in our catalog such as Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Bill Withers, Chic, Ojays, Sunshine Anderson, Dionne Farris, Kool and The Gang, etc, they are looking to use the \"Music Of The Sea\" brand and artist!\n\nWe have the attention of many major networks and they want to use the artist and composers from our catalog! Have your song/tracks along ride along side the major artist in our catalog and grow your brand!!! \"High Quality\" tracks only, no exceptions! No Demos and unmastered tracks, no uncleared samples. You must have clean versions available, and you must own master and publishing rights! Huge opportunity!\n\nIf you have music in our catalog, your music is automatically being considered.\n\n- Eddie Sea / Music Of The Sea\n\nWhy the higher than average submission fee?\n\nOften we hear music that doesn’t make the final cut for a particular opportunity but we go ahead and select the song anyway because we believe the song is appropriate for other opportunities we’re working on. Here at Music of The Sea, we fill dozens of sync requests every week. We don’t have time to listen to everything so the higher submission fee tends to discourage all but the best - and we sign a lot of music and we place almost all of it.\n\nWe only offer one deal and the terms are the same for everyone, so don’t submit if you’re seeking another type of deal. If we select your song, you give us exclusive rights to the song for 3 years. If after three years we haven’t licensed your song, the rights revert back to you. If we do license your song, we share in the revenue. Often, if we love the song we hear and want to work with you we will also have interest in hearing other songs in your catalog and possibly doing a broader deal.",

As he rides through the open fields of Mississippi, he reminisces about the highs and lows of their time together, ultimately finding peace in the memories and the lessons learned from loving and losing.",

It delves into her connections with her past loves and the personal growth that comes from embracing her roots and the bittersweet reunions.",
				"The narrative focuses on a small-town musician grappling with the death of his lifelong partner. Using a blend of folk and bluegrass, the lyrics explore his profound sense of loss but gradually shift to a more hopeful tone as he finds solace in music and the community around him, illustrating his journey from despair to acceptance and rediscovery of joy."

			"request_description": "\"How to build a successful band\" Career CoachingReggie Calloway, Grammy-nominated, multi platinum former leader of Midnight Star, this month answers questions and discusses, \"How to build a successful band\"The five time Grammy-nominated Reggie Calloway has always displayed a unique ear for music and trends. It is no surprise that the music pioneer received a Grammy nomination for R&B Songwriter of the Year for the hit song “Casanova” in 1987. \n\nBest known as the founder and leader of one of the most popular Techno-funk bands, Midnight Star, Calloway led the group to international success by writing, producing and arranging a string of top mega #1 hits including, “Operator,” “No Parking On The Dance Floor,” “I Wanna Be Rich” and “Freak-a-zoid.” \n\nOne of Calloway’s original compositions entitled, “I’ll Be Good For You,” was featured on N’Sync’s multi-platinum CD, No Strings Attached (highest selling album of the last decade). He has also penned songs for the chart-topping group Levert (“Casanova”), the sultry Teddy Pendergrass (“Joy”), Grammy-winning Gladys Knight (“Love Overboard”) and “Jump Start My Love” for Natalie Cole.",

			"request_description": "Artists only please: Detailed Evaluation & ReviewArtists Only: Detailed Evaluation & Review\nIf your passion is to entertain and edify people with your talent, this is your opportunity to be heard. We are looking for artists with exceptional, recognizable voices and styles to sign to our artist development company. Your ability to write your own songs is a plus but not a necessity.\nPlease give us a detailed description of your performing experience, artists with whom you identify and who have influenced you, known artist(s) for whom you could open, and the amount of touring you would be able to do based on your relationships and/or job. If you would like us to hear complete songs, submit them, or if you'd rather give us a taste of some different songs, you can submit a show reel medley not longer than five minutes. For every submission, we'll open a conversation with you so we can go further than just a critique of the submission. That conversation will stay open until we've given you every observation and piece of advice we can think of. We won't mince words, so be prepared to get an extremely detailed and honest evaluation of your talent, including what we think your strengths and weaknesses are and what we believe your chances of making it as an artist would be. A small percentage of artists rise to the top. If you aspire to be in that number, let us hear from you. This opportunity is somewhat higher in price than the average opportunity on Xray because we will take the time to deeply evaluate your songs, videos and links. We can't guarantee that we will be able to work with you, but at the minimum, you'll benefit from our 50 years experience in the music industry.- Warren Ells -\nOwner - SeaSoDeep Music and SeaBeyondShore Music ASCAP",

Imagine the protagonist facing each hardship, from personal setbacks to professional rejections, but ultimately showcasing how each challenge contributes to their growth and eventual victory. The beat drops would emphasize reflective moments of doubt, followed by crescendos that mirror the euphoria of overcoming those doubts.",
				"The lyrics might explore the theme of self-discovery and empowerment through the metaphor of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Each verse could portray a different part of the struggle, ending with a powerful realization of one's own strength and potential. The final verse or bridge would then culminate in a powerful declaration of independence and self-acceptance, aligning with the beat's rise and fall to enhance the emotional journey."

The song starts with a powerful beat that intensifies as the protagonist recounts their early struggles in a relentless urban environment, building up excitement and anticipation. As the track reaches its peak, it reflects on the peak moments of success before suddenly dropping into a quieter, introspective breakdown where the protagonist considers the personal sacrifices made for their career.",
				"The lyrics follow an underdog in the music industry who battles through numerous setbacks and dismissals but remains steadfast in their pursuit of success. The composition alternates between high-energy sections that highlight the moments of victory and progress, and softer, more reflective moments that delve into the emotional costs of such a path. This narrative structure not only demonstrates the rise and fall theme but also encapsulates the essence of empowerment and resilience.",
				"The lyrics tell the story of a talented performer who faces both internal and external challenges on their way to stardom. Starting with a pulsating beat that grows in intensity, the song captures the excitement of performing and the euphoria of gradually gaining recognition. However, as the energy of the music drops, the lyrics shift to a more contemplative tone, pondering the loneliness and the loss of privacy that comes with fame, providing a balanced perspective on the highs and lows of the music industry."

As the beat intensifies, the narrative explores the protagonist's relentless drive and the pivotal moments that lead to their breakthrough. The track would climax with a triumphant chorus celebrating victory, before a reflective bridge where the protagonist considers the personal costs of their success.",
				"The lyrics detail the story of an underdog in a competitive environment, struggling initially but gradually gaining confidence. The song builds as the character faces and overcomes various challenges, leading to a crescendo where they achieve their ultimate goal. The final verses would focus on the empowerment and self-assurance gained through these experiences, providing a potent message of resilience and perseverance.",
				"The lyrics portray a young artist's path to self-discovery and artistic identity through the music industry's highs and lows. The song starts with the artist feeling unsure and overwhelmed but grows in intensity as they find their voice and style. The climax would be a powerful declaration of their newfound confidence, followed by a quieter moment where they reflect on how their journey has shaped them and the values they've had to uphold."

Here at Music of The Sea, we fill dozens of sync requests every week. We don’t have time to listen to everything so the higher submission fee tends to discourage all but the best - and we sign a lot of music and we place almost all of it. \n\nWe only offer one deal and the terms are the same for everyone, so don’t submit if you’re seeking another type of deal. If we select your song, you give us exclusive rights to the song for 3 years. If after three years we haven’t licensed your song, the rights revert back to you. If we do license your song, we share in the revenue. Often, if we love the song we hear and want to work with you we will also have interest in hearing other songs in your catalog and possibly doing a broader deal.",

Preferably looking for full songs with either male or female vocals or both.  Songs can be about any subject matter as long as they aren't so specific that their use would be limited.  For instance, if lyrics talk about a specific year or event in pop culture or history or mention being in a specific city or country, that may limit our ability to use the song.\nWe are looking for great Hard Rock Anthems for pitching to CBS Sports and Fox Sports for the upcoming NFL season.  Songs should be current sounding and compare to leading artists and songs in the genre.\n\nIf we think your submission may fit, we will place it on hold for further review by the entire team working on this project.  If it is selected, we will contact you further with details. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a “submission-only” dropbox.  We are looking for the perfect song for this pitch.  We will not be giving detailed feedback on submissions.  Either we feel the song may fit the brief or it doesn’t.  We apologize for not being able to give feedback beyond whether it fits or not, but the time constraints of the nature of these projects will not allow us the time to give in-depth feedback on the song.  We will, however, submit ratings on every submission.Incorporated Elements is a company that works with songwriters, artists, producers, and DJ's to help them perfect their craft and fully realize the potential in their art.

It talks about seizing every day, making spontaneous decisions, and experiencing life’s adventures with full energy. Throughout, the lyrics maintain a cheerful, encouraging narrative that could push listeners to take chances and celebrate each moment as if it were their last, perfectly fitting the vibrant essence of EDM.",
				"This track would be about surrendering to the joy of the present, letting go of past burdens and the uncertainty of the future. The chorus could highlight the importance of cherishing now, with lines like \"The past is just echoes, the future unseen, dive into now where life’s living unlean.\" This message promotes embracing the current vibe, a perfect sentiment for a lively EDM track aiming to elevate mood and bring people together.",
				"This lyric idea revolves around a story of a night out filled with dance and laughter, illustrating a carefree and exhilarating scene of living spontaneously. The chorus could repeat phrases like \"No regrets, just beats,\" symbolizing the free-spirited abandon and the hedonistic joy found in the simplicity of the moment. This concept directly aligns with TALUS's vision for upbeat and engaging EDM music."

It is no surprise that the music pioneer received a Grammy nomination for R&B Songwriter of the Year for the hit song “Casanova” in 1987.\n\nBest known as the founder and leader of one of the most popular Techno-funk bands, Midnight Star, Calloway led the group to international success by writing, producing and arranging a string of top mega #1 hits including, “Operator,” “No Parking On The Dance Floor,” “I Wanna Be Rich” and “Freak-a-zoid.”\n\nOne of Calloway’s original compositions entitled, “I’ll Be Good For You,” was featured on N’Sync’s multi-platinum CD, No Strings Attached (highest selling album of the last decade). He has also penned songs for the chart-topping group Levert (“Casanova”), the sultry Teddy Pendergrass (“Joy”), Grammy-winning Gladys Knight (“Love Overboard”) and “Jump Start My Love” for Natalie Cole.",

Artists are vetted by Grenier and his team: Damien Paris, Mike Frankel, and Brian Koerber.

When I work with you I begin by finding out about you, what you like, and where you've been. I learn who your favorite artists are, who inspires you, what entertains you or brings you joy. Always authentic I speak to you on a human level and share freely about lessons and tips I've learned along the way. I've been at The SoundBeat corp for the past 8 years. Before that I worked at Polygram Classics & Jazz, as well as Rolling Stone Magazine. I feel lucky every day that I can work with what I love - music & people - and I don't have to wear a suit!\n\n- Emmy Sound / The Sound Beat (Sound Beat Music Entertainment)",

L7 Music Group is a worldwide digital distribution, publishing and licensing company that strives to take indie artists, from all genres, to the next level. We were founded in February 2017 with over 40 years of hands-on experience in the music industry, collectively. Our growing company excels in getting artists’ music to the masses and getting them paid for their musical works. Unlike most distribution services, we do not charge a fee to distribute with our company. Instead, we split the profits with our artists 80-20, with the artist taking the lion’s share of the profits from their music. We distribute to over 250 downloading & streaming markets and have an 85% success rate on getting artists music in rotation on Pandora. We realize that times have changed and that the method of hand-to-hand CD sells is slowing diminishing, so we've decided to assist artists in building an online presence by offering our services to those artists who really want to be heard, foreign and domestic.- Geoffrey Domingues -\nCEO - L7 Music Group",

We have music in \"King Of Staten Island\", \"Once Upon In Hollywood\",  \"Shape Of Water\" and 1000's of more Major Films and TV Shows!!  Join the Music Of The Sea Revolution!\n\nIf you sign with Music Of The Sea your music will be part of NBC/UNI, CBS Television, Vice, Omnicom system networks upon signing with us. We have deals with these Major Networks.\n\nBecause of the \"High Profile Major Artists\" in our catalog such as Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Bill Withers, Chic, Ojays, Sunshine Anderson, Dionne Farris, Kool and The Gang, etc, they are looking to use the \"Music Of The Sea\" brand and artist!\n\nWe have the attention of many major networks and they want to use the artist and composers from our catalog! Have your song/tracks along ride along side the major artist in our catalog and grow your brand!!! \"High Quality\" tracks only, no exceptions! No Demos and unmastered tracks, no uncleared samples. You must have clean versions available, and you must own master and publishing rights! Huge opportunity!\n\nIf you have music in our catalog, your music is automatically being considered.\n\n- Eddie Sea / Music Of The Sea\n\nWhy the higher than average submission fee?\n\nOften we hear music that doesn’t make the final cut for a particular opportunity but we go ahead and select the song anyway because we believe the song is appropriate for other opportunities we’re working on. Here at Music of The Sea, we fill dozens of sync requests every week. We don’t have time to listen to everything so the higher submission fee tends to discourage all but the best - and we sign a lot of music and we place almost all of it.\n\nWe only offer one deal and the terms are the same for everyone, so don’t submit if you’re seeking another type of deal. If we select your song, you give us exclusive rights to the song for 3 years. If after three years we haven’t licensed your song, the rights revert back to you. If we do license your song, we share in the revenue. Often, if we love the song we hear and want to work with you we will also have interest in hearing other songs in your catalog and possibly doing a broader deal.",

Clients are professional film makers, video production companies, games developers, advertising agencies etc, that produce high-end content. \n\nMusic used by clients will be licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), simply go 50-50 on deals we get for you, you’re paid quarterly and keep 100% of all royalties generated from placements. \n \nArtist's will receive between £50-£1,000+ per track depending on use, type of project etc, and music will be available for all licensing opportunities. So, if you have any amazing Dance music tracks, I’d really love to hear from you! \n\nNB; If you have already had music accepted into our catalogue that is suitable for this brief, you don’t need to re-submit as your music will automatically be pitched to our clients as well! Thanks! \n\nLooking forward to hearing your music and working with you :) \n \nAll the best, \nGiles Gale \n\nMusic Supervisor",

The lyrics recount stopping at random scenic spots, singing along to classic 70's tunes on the radio, and the liberating feeling of escaping everyday routines for adventures on the open road.",
				"A catchy, high-energy track about throwing a retro-themed dance party, where everyone dresses up in 70's disco attire and lets loose on the dance floor. The lyrics focus on the fun of getting ready for the party, memorable dance moves, and the pure joy of losing yourself in the music, all tying back to the carefree party vibe of the era."

				"The lyrics is about a young rebel who defies societal norms and expectations, passionately embracing the freedom and risks that come with it. The verses delve into different acts of rebellion, from mundane rule-breaking to significant social stands, while the chorus emphasizes the exhilarating but isolating path of defiance. The song concludes with a reflective verse on the personal costs and societal impact of such rebellious acts.",
				"The lyrics tells the story of a rock band in the 80s, challenging the oppressive music industry and societal constraints of their time, echoing the raw energy and spirit of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The narrative captures the band's journey, packed with electric gigs, confrontations with authority, and a strong anti-establishment message, climaxing to a poignant realization about the bittersweet triumphs and losses of their rebellion.",
				"The lyrics portrays an individual's internal battle against conformity, with each verse recounting different scenarios where they push back against cultural and familial expectations to carve out their own identity. The chorus reinforces the theme with a powerful, rebellious guitar riff, and the song culminates in a powerful final verse that acknowledges the personal growth and sometimes painful consequences of such steadfast nonconformity."

				"**Overcoming Personal Hardships**: The lyrics tell the story of an individual struggling with personal challenges, possibly battling a tough phase in their life such as financial hardship, loss, or self-doubt. The music starts with a slow, melancholic melody that captures the weight of these challenges. As the song progresses, the melody transforms into an uplifting, triumphant tune reflecting the character's journey towards overcoming these adversities and finding hope and success, resonating with a broad audience in a relatable and motivational manner.",
				"**Journey of Self-Discovery and Triumph**: This song follows the emotional journey of someone discovering their true self and potential against all odds. The lyrics depict scenes of introspection and realization, beginning with doubt and confusion represented by a slower, somber tone. As the character gains confidence and starts embracing their true self, the music shifts to a more dynamic, energetic, and joyful crescendo, symbolizing their triumphant emergence as a stronger, self-assured individual.",
				"**Entrepreneurial Success Story**: The lyrics focus on an aspiring entrepreneur facing numerous setbacks and naysayers. Initially portrayed through a slower, reflective melody, the character's initial struggles with starting a business and encountering failures are laid bare. As they learn from their mistakes and persist in their endeavors, the music transitions into an uplifting and empowering sequence that celebrates their eventual success and the fulfillment of their dreams, aligning well with the idea of struggle turning into triumph."

			"request_description": "Seeking new male group / boy band for global song release and touringWE NEED FIVE FANTASTIC SINGERS FROM THE USA/UK WHO TOGETHER BECOME “HIGH FIVE”, THE NEW MALE GROUP / BOY BAND! APPLY AND SUBMIT FOR FREE IF YOU’RE INTERESTED!\n\nAward-winning multi platinum selling songwriter/producer together with Sony Music, is looking for the new pop male group / boy band to globally release and promote the brand new hit potential 90’s pop song “Come on”. Name of the male group / boy band will be “High Five”. \n\nWe are looking to form a group of five male singers from between 18 and 35 years.  Are you a professional male singer (between 18 and 35) with a great voice, or you are not a professional yet, but you believe or people say you have talent, and interested in committing to this project, then please apply for free, we ask no submission fee.  We accept acapella submissions as well as full demo versions. The quality does not have to be top notch, just as long as we can hear your singing voice clearly.\n\nOur mission is to become very successful, as we believe this song that will be released including videoclip, is really strong. When the song would become a success, we will be recording at least six other brand-new 90’s pop songs with lots of harmonies and great melodies and we will be touring in many countries.\n\nPlease note: We treat everybody equal; all singers would get equally paid when doing gigs/shows, and they have an equal position / equal vote in the group as we are looking for five equally strong voices. You are not treated as a number like many group members of boybands in the past were treated. So we do not have one solo singer and four “backing vocals”. We accept any male between 18 and 35, just as long as your voice is at least above average.\n\nArtist/Talents: Here is the hidden link to the hidden demo song \"Come on\" (with reference vocals) that we are talking about, that is set to be recorded and released as soon as we have the group together.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzH4CQ7G6HQ\n\nSuccess and best wishes!\n\n- Key Music Entertainment / Creativity Factory",

				"The lyrics of the song \"Come On\" tell the story of a young man's relentless pursuit of his musical dreams, despite facing numerous setbacks. With an energetic and motivational tone, the song encourages listeners to never give up, emphasizing that every step, every failure, is a part of the journey to success. The chorus is catchy and uplifting, directly addressing the listener with lines like \"Come on, keep the fire alive, you're close to reaching skies!\"",
				"The song uses the metaphor of a journey to describe the process of chasing dreams. Each verse introduces different stages of the pursuit, from the initial spark of passion to the struggles and eventual breakthroughs. The lyrics provide inspiration by detailing the sheer determination needed to overcome obstacles, with lines such as \"Climb every mountain, ford every stream, chase your dreams, let your spirit soar high.\"",
				"\"Come On\" is crafted as an anthem for unity and camaraderie among the group members and their fans. The lyrics emphasize the power of collaboration and mutual support in achieving shared dreams. With a heartwarming bridge that underscores the importance of believing in each other, the song includes lines like \"Together we stand, in the spotlight’s glare, hands in the air, voices strong and true!\" This promotes a message of equality and partnership which aligns with the group’s ethos of each member having an equal voice."

				"**Chasing Dreams on Dirt Roads:** The song revolves around a young person in a small town, blending elements of country life with aspirations fueled by hip-hop beats. The story details the struggles of chasing dreams where the big city lights meet country stars. Verses highlight the hard work and hurdles faced, building up to a powerful chorus about breaking barriers and achieving dreams against all odds. The bridge features a reflective moment, acknowledging the sacrifices made and the roots that keep them grounded.",
				"**Crossroads Anthem:** This track captures the journey of an artist at the crossroads of genres, uniting the storytelling traditions of country with the rhythm and audacity of hip-hop. The lyrics narrate overcoming genre prejudice and musical battles, building to an exhilarating chorus celebrating the fusion of musical worlds. A quieter bridge reflects on the artist's identity crisis and the cultural blend that defines them, emphasizing the personal growth that comes with artistic innovation.",
				"**Heart Beats in the Hometown:** Focused on the contrast between small-town values and big-city dreams, this song tells the story of a local hero who makes it big in the music industry but struggles with their new identity. The verses build intensity and pace, encapsulating the thrill of success and the energy of hip-hop, while the chorus brings a catchy, uplifting melody typical of pop country. The song drops into a reflective, slower-paced bridge where the singer reminisces about home, acknowledging the cost of their success."

			"request_description": "Offering song critiques for J-pop and K-pop marketsIn this dropbox, Audity Music is offering the opportunity for expert critique of your song with an eye towards helping you understand what is required to make records that work in the Japan and Korea markets. \n\nAudity has an especially strong niche in Asia, having relationships with top songwriters, producers, record labels, publishers and other key players that are difficult to rival. Our on-the-ground experience in Japan and Korea has given us the opportunity to develop a unique expertise in both markets. Now, we are offering to share our knowledge with you in order to boost your chances of successful pitching and placement in Asia. A lot of writers come to us seeking information about and access to the Asia markets. Here's your chance.\n\nWhy YOU should consider Asia?\n\nJapan is the second largest music market in the world, not very far behind the U.S. in terms of annual music revenues. If you ignore Japan, you could be giving up substantial income as a songwriter; indeed you may find that income in Japan exceeds income in your home market if you can create the music sought in the Japanese market and have the right avenues in which to pitch it. Additionally, Korea is a very strong market in Asia that tends to lean a bit more Western in its music soundscape. the K-pop market has been growing increasingly strong in recent years, especially on the international scene as Korean record labels have been excellent as pushing K-Pop outside of Korea and even outside of Asia to Europe, America, South America, etc.\n\nChina/Taiwan is another growing force to be reckoned with and strongly considered by songwriters as China's intellectual property protection and licensing regime comes into form. You will find that all the major U.S. labels, Korean labels, Japanese labels, etc are now partnering with Chinese companies to be prepared for when China's regime truly comes online. And, Mandopop is a strong force in China, largely emanating from Taiwan.\n\nIf you want Audity Music's expertise on Asia markets for your benefit, submit here! We encourage writers to pursue the diversification of markets for their music and always have an international mindset. Music is the universal language after all!\n\nIf we REALLY like your song(s) and think has placement potential with some additional production/editing/co-writing, we may be in touch via direct message to work further with you and offer such services. And, if we think your song(s) is already a good fit for the markets, we may reach out to discuss representation of your music in Asia and beyond. Again, Asia is our particularly unique niche. However, we pitch music around the world. We're not here to just take fees. We want to find great writers and work with them! Our expert critiques will take time significantly more time than simply voting \"Selected\" or \"Not Selected\", thus the higher submission fee. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your songs!\n- Audity Music, LLC",

Take advantage of this opportunity to get your music in front of a seasoned professional who can help. Stuart Epps is happy to receive your submissions and provide you with a thoughtful song critique. He will provide his opinion on the song, the production or any other aspect that is of particular interest to you as well as Stuart's opinion regarding the commercial viability of the track. Stuart will also consider songs submitted to this drop box for potential production / development deals and will contact you about this to gauge your interest if he is blown away by what he hears. If you would simply like to be considered for a production / development deal and do not want a critique please submit to Stuart's other drop box under this profile. For most production deals there will be a fee involved which will be discussed. Some of Epps' most noteworthy clients have included Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Chris Rea, George Harrison, Mick Fleetwood, Barry White, George Michael, Mark Owen, Cliff Richard, Twisted Sister, Brian Adams, Oasis, Kiki Dee, Robbie Williams, Bill Wyman and of course Elton John. In recent years he has continued to work with big name artists to great acclaim, as well as helping a host of promising new and up-and-coming artists to sound their best, both on demo recordings and in full studio productions.",

The narrative builds around the character's daring acts against conformity, leading to a climactic realization of the impact these actions have on their personal life and on those around them.",

The lyrics explore themes of revolt and defiance against established authority, ending with a contemplative verse that reflects on the chaos and order, providing a provocative yet introspective view on rebelling."

Here at Music of The Sea, we fill dozens of sync requests every week. We don’t have time to listen to everything so the higher submission fee tends to discourage all but the best - and we sign a lot of music and we place almost all of it.\n\nWe only offer one deal and the terms are the same for everyone, so don’t submit if you’re seeking another type of deal. If we select your song, you give us exclusive rights to the song for 3 years. If after three years we haven’t licensed your song, the rights revert back to you. If we do license your song, we share in the revenue. Often, if we love the song we hear and want to work with you we will also have interest in hearing other songs in your catalog and possibly doing a broader deal.",

Clients are professional film makers, TV/video production companies, games developers, advertising agencies etc, that produce high-end content. \n\nMusic used by clients will be licensed on a non-exclusive basis (so you maintain all rights to your music), we simply go 50-50 on deals we get for you, you’re paid quarterly and keep 100% of all royalties generated from placements. \n \nArtist's will receive between £50-£1,000+ per track depending on use, type of project etc, and music will be available for all licensing opportunities. So, if you have any amazing Hip Hop tracks, I’d really love to hear from you! \n\nNB; If you have already had music accepted into our catalogue that is suitable for this brief, you don’t need to re-submit as your music will automatically be pitched to our clients.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your music and working with you!\n \nAll the best, \nGiles Gale \n\nMusic Supervisor",

We have cues for action, romance, loss, Finding love, thrillers, killers, spillers, but not Ben Stillers.\n\nIn today's music business there are a lot of bands and artists who deserve deals, but with the industry in the state it is and the uncertainty of labels giving new bands money, they now want to see some kind of exposure first and getting a song in a film or TV show is a massive step and one of the best chances of nailing the record deal, so with that in mind...\n\nAlexander Johnston, head of the Grand Northern Group / Grand Northern Sync is an industry composer/producer and music supervisor for various Hollywood and Global Film Production companies, film producers and writers and he is regularly sought out by various companies to either compose or over see the music for the various projects.\n\nHe is looking for songs of all genres and styles for placement in film and TV, it really can be anything, he wants to hear it all, as he is a great believer in everything should have a chance and he is convinced there are real quality people out there not getting the shots they deserve\n\nQuality of recording is not essential as we may re-record certain songs if needed but quality of writing and lyrics must be top notch.\n\nDeal Type: Sync Placement\nDecision Maker: Selected tracks will be pitched for final decision\nDeal Structure: Negotiable\nCompensation: TBD based on placement from $1000-$25,000\n\n- Alexander Johnston - CEO, Producer, Composer, Mixer, Musician - Grand Northern Sync",

As the song progresses, the melody and lyrics gradually build to a climax that reflects a turning point where the character gathers strength, overcomes their challenges, and emerges stronger, ready to face the world anew.",

The lyrics begin with a detailed portrayal of the person’s initial despair and loneliness, slowly transitioning into a phase of self-discovery and growth.

				"This song captures the essence of venturing into the unknown to pursue one's dreams. The lyrics detail a journey filled with challenges, but ultimately, the joy of overcoming these obstacles boosts one's confidence and self-belief. Verses depict moments of doubt and the encouragement from loved ones, while the chorus emphasizes the endless pursuit of personal goals and the continual growth that comes with it.",
				"The narrative focuses on an individual facing numerous setbacks but continually finding the strength to rise above them. Each verse introduces different hurdles, from personal to professional challenges, and how the protagonist uses each setback as a stepping stone. The chorus would be a powerful, anthemic shout to resilience, celebrating the triumph over adversity and the sweet victory of pursuing passions against all odds.",
				"This song tells the story of a relentless dreamer who refuses to be hindered by life's obstacles. The lyrics reflect on past failures and the lessons learned, with a strong focus on pushing forward despite the odds. The bridge offers a moment of introspection about the importance of dreams in giving life purpose and direction, while the chorus is an uplifting and bold affirmation of the unstoppable nature of someone driven by their dreams."

Using the imagery of a long, dusty road and relentless determination, the song captures the essence of pushing past failures and relentlessly pursuing dreams. Each verse builds on the resilience required to rise after each fall, culminating in a powerful chorus that inspires listeners to never give up, embodying the spirit of passionate and determined characters.",
				"This song would depict the journey of someone pursuing their dreams against all odds, using the metaphors of navigating through dark woods lit only by fireflies. The lyrics explore themes of self-belief and persistence, with the protagonist's journey reflecting struggles similar to those faced by many aspiring individuals. The chorus underscores a message of hope and motivation, encouraging listeners to keep moving towards their goals, even when the path seems obscure and challenging.",
				"Focused on someone who decides to take control of their life and chase their dreams despite societal expectations, this song connects with those looking to make substantial changes in their lives. The verses detail the obstacles and naysayers the protagonist encounters, while the chorus celebrates the exhilarating freedom and fulfillment found in pursuing one's true passions. The motif of \"winds of change\" serves as a reminder that it is never too late to steer one's life toward their deepest desires and aspirations."

Your submissions should have unforgettable choruses, ear-worm melodies, powerful rhythms, solid arrangements, and well-written lyrics. Modern Country instrumentation that's in the general stylistic wheelhouse of the references will work best for this pitch. Please make sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are high quality and not dated-sounding. Expressive and well-performed Male vocals are key!\n\nTAXI Tip: Vocal deliveries can often make or break Song pitches. Making sure that the vocals in your Songs are well-performed, compelling, and rich with Country authenticity will likely increase your chances of getting this Artist excited about your Songs!\n\nStripped-down demos and full productions are both okay to submit, as long as your Songs are great and your recordings are clean, clear, and well-balanced! Do NOT copy the references in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, texture, and overall vibe.\n\nNOTEWORTHY: If time permits, someone from the Publisher's staff (who has been trained as a TAXI screener) will screen for this request. That means that somebody who is directly involved in this request could be \"ears-on\" with your submissions.\n\nThe specific deal points will be negotiated on a Song-by-Song basis directly with the Publisher. Please submit as many Songs as you like, online or per CD, and PLEASE include lyrics! Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Saturday, May 11th, 2024. TAXI # S240511CY",

				"The lyrics is about reflecting on a past love lost to the passage of time, where the singer recounts cherished memories and the pain of separation, using nature and seasons as metaphors for the cycles of relationship and healing. The song begins with a somber melody showcasing the initial heartbreak, then gradually transforms as the singer comes to terms with the loss, finding solace and acceptance in the enduring beauty of the world around them.",
				"The lyrics tell the story of a journey from heartbreak to self-discovery, where the singer starts in a place of despair and isolation, feeling left behind in a small town after a love moves away. As the song progresses, the tone shifts to one of introspection and eventual empowerment, with the singer embracing their roots and the strength found in solitude, ultimately moving forward with a sense of renewed purpose and hope.",
				"The lyrics describe the bittersweet feeling of revisiting old places that hold memories of a once-vibrant relationship, now gone. The song focuses on the contrast between the past happiness and the present sorrow, but evolves into a narrative of healing as the singer learns to cherish the good memories without letting them overshadow his or her current life. The music captures this transition with a mix of melancholic chords that resolve into a more uplifting, reflective melody toward the end."

				"**Overcoming the Odds**: Lyrics that narrate a journey of a talented artist rising from a tough neighborhood to achieving mainstream success. The song’s narrative would focus on the challenges faced, including doubters and personal setbacks, painting a vivid picture of perseverance and ultimate victory. The beat could build up during scenes of struggle, drop to reflect moments of doubt, and soar as the artist finds success, perfectly meshing with the theme of rising tension and eventual triumph.",
				"**Underdog to Champion**: This track would describe the life of an individual who starts with nothing but uses their unique skills and relentless effort to break into the rap scene, eventually becoming a role model. The lyrics would focus on the grind, the hustle, and the sheer determination that turns an underdog into a celebrated figure in hip-hop, aligning with the empowered and confident typecast required by the A&R listing.",
				"**Reflections on Sacrifice**: A reflective, yet energetic track that discusses the sacrifices made on the road to success, juxtaposing the highs of achieving fame against the lows of personal sacrifices. The song would have an energetic rise showing the excitement of fame and a sudden drop to a slower tempo as the artist reflects on what was lost along the way. This could provide a compelling narrative of contrast, aligning well with the specified content of rise, fall, and reflective storytelling."

The campaign emphasizes fearless creativity, aiming to resonate with audiences through compelling storytelling.\n\nMusic Requirement:\n\nThe selected track should exude an indie rock vibe akin to \"Welcome to my Island,\" featuring a strong beat and uplifting vocals. The overall tone should channel the spirit of artists like Karen O and Caroline, with a distinct \"left of the dial\" appeal. The lyrics must strike a balance between relevance and neutrality, avoiding overly celebratory or melancholic themes. The emphasis lies on impactful vocals and a dynamic progression that complements the video narrative.\n\nClient Preferences:\n\nPreferably vocals-driven, with lyrics that resonate without veering into clichéd or overly empowering territory. The song should possess a certain edge while maintaining a universal appeal.\n\n\nExclusivity and Usage:\n\nExclusivity is granted to similar brands within the whiskey industry. The global campaign spans across various mediums, including social media, CTV/digital platforms (limited to the US and UK), and Out-of-Home advertising. Usage rights extend for one year across all channels, with paid media usage restricted to six months in the US, UK, and Sweden.\n\nBudget:\n\nTotal budget allocation stands at $30,000 All-In (Less all Fees), covering all aspects of music acquisition and licensing.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nCreativity and relevance are paramount in song selection, aligning closely with the brand's ethos and the campaign's overarching theme of fearless innovation.\n\nPlease include lyrics, Composer (PRO/IPI)\n\nBroadcast Quality is needed.\n\nYou must own or control your Master and Copyright to pitch for this opportunity.

				"**Chasing Horizons:** The song captures the wanderlust and the drive to explore uncharted territories, both physically and metaphorically. The lyrics navigate the journey of an individual who defies conventions, pursuing their passions relentlessly, akin to the way a boutique whiskey might forge its own unique path in a saturated market. The chorus emphasizes the exhilarating rush of charting one's course, perfectly pairing with the whiskey brand's narrative of innovation and brinkmanship.",
				"**Echoes of Triumph:** This track celebrates the quiet, internal victories that come from overcoming personal doubts and societal expectations. Lyrics would focus on the theme of resilience, building gradually to a powerful, anthemic chorus that reflects the crescendo of overcoming challenges. This mirrors the marketing angle of a distinguished whiskey making its mark in a competitive industry, appealing to consumers who see themselves as sophisticated and victorious against the odds.",
				"**Between the Shadows:** Utilizing a metaphorical approach, this song delves into the theme of moving through the shadows of uncertainty and doubt towards a place of self-realization and clarity. The verses would explore themes of introspection and the struggles encountered during this journey, culminating in a powerful revelation in the chorus that aligns with the brand's vision of breaking new ground and creating an unparalleled whiskey experience."

			"request_description": "ORIGINAL BLUEGRASS INSTRUMENTALS are needed by a Film/TV Music Publisher for (up to) $5,000 placements in an upcoming Hulu Series!\n\nThis Publisher is on the hunt for Mid Tempo Instrumentals that could work as a replacement for \"Another Night\" by Ricky Skaggs:\n\n\"Another Night\" by Ricky Skaggs\n\nAlthough the reference has vocals, please submit Instrumentals only for this request.\n\nIMPORTANT: They're NOT looking for clones or soundalikes! Similar tempo, style, and overall vibe? Yes. Clones? No!\n\nQUOTING THE COMPANY: \"We like the mid-tempo and acoustic approach of \"Another Night\" by Ricky Skaggs, and would like to hear instrumentals with the same mood, vibe, and energy.\"\n\nPlease send in original, well-crafted Bluegrass Instrumentals with lots of deep-south vibes and authentic Bluegrass musicianship! Your submissions should have depression-era motifs, expressive musical performances, sparse melodies, swung rhythms, and dynamic arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest. Bluegrass instrumentation that's in the general stylistic wheelhouse of the reference will work best for this opportunity, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, etc. Live instrumentation is strongly suggested, but if you choose to use virtual instruments or samples, make sure they are high-quality, very realistic-sounding, and appropriate for the genre.\n\nAll submissions should be roughly 2 to 4 minutes in length (give or take). Non-faded, Buttoned endings will work best. Please do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use it only as a general guide for tempo, texture, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nNOTE: The sync fees we were quoted were up to $5,000; however, our experience tells us that number is probably based on them licensing Instrumentals from a well-known act through a big publisher like Sony or Universal. We think the sync fees could be lower (in the $1,500 to $2,500 range) for an unknown, independent act or music licensed from a music library. It could go higher – we’re just being cautious and conservative.\n\nThis Publisher offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal. You’ll split any applicable sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Master rights and the Writer’s share, and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher's Share for any placements they generate. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright to submit for this opportunity. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by a TAXI screener that was handpicked by the Music Publisher. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Thursday, May 9th, 2024.

Your submissions should have soothing organic sounds, ambient electronic-based sounds, or a tasteful blend of both.

All your elements should flow easily and cohesively with nothing sticking out in an attention-grabbing way. The goal is to evoke a relaxed state without drawing attention to the music or production itself!\n\nIMPORTANT: Please do NOT include any sound effects in your music such as animal sounds, waterfalls, wind chimes, raindrops, etc.\n\nYour Instrumentals should be at least 2 minutes long and no longer than 4 minutes, give or take. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and vibe. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nQuoting the Company: “Only artists/writers affiliated with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SACEM, IMRO, APRA AMCOS, SOCAN, including all Scandinavian and Latin American PROs, are eligible to submit their music for this opportunity.”\n\nThis company offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE deal, so you will keep 100% of all Composition and Master Rights.

The refrain juxtaposes the intoxicating allure of the night with the sobering daylight after-party realities.",
				"The lyrics describe a whirlwind romance that starts in a bustling club scene. It navigates through the joy of instant connection and the chaos of miscommunications, culminating in a bittersweet finale as the characters realize they're better apart, echoing the temporary exhilaration and inevitable closure of a night out.",
				"The lyrics focus on the theme of letting loose and ignoring the pressures of everyday life. Verses explore various party scenarios—laughing with friends, spontaneous adventures, flirting—with a chorus that underscores the importance of living in the moment, yet acknowledges the impending return to normalcy and responsibilities as the party ends."

Your submissions should have gravelly melodies, memorable choruses, engaging rhythms, and well-written lyrics. Instrumentation in the general wheelhouse of the references will work best for this opportunity, such as acoustic/slide guitar, banjo, harmonica, etc. We recommend using real instruments, but if you use any virtual instruments or samples, they should be high-quality, genre-appropriate, and realistic sounding. Authentic, and well-performed Male vocals are needed.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: This Company is NOT looking for modern Country Songs or anything with an overly-produced sound. Please pay extra close attention to the references to get a good take on their overall vibe, while taking extra care not to copy or clone them.\n\nLyrics should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity. Please do NOT copy the referenced artists or songs in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, texture, and tone. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal, so please be sure the Songs you pitch for this opportunity are NOT already signed with any other Companies or Catalogs.

			"request_description": "ORIGINAL JAZZ INSTRUMENTALS with SWING are needed by a Film/TV Music Publisher for (up to) $5,000 placements in an upcoming Hulu Series!\n\nThis Publisher is on the hunt for Mid Tempo Instrumentals that could be heard on a playlist with the following:\n\n\"The Way You Look Tonight\" by Frank Sinatra\n\n\"Moonlight Becomes You\" by Eddie Higgins\n\n\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\" by Billie Holiday\n\n\"April In Paris\" by Count Basie\n\nAlthough some of the references have vocals, please submit Instrumentals only for this request.\n\nQUOTING THE COMPANY: \"We are looking for old-school Jazz with swing. (some blues-influence could potentially work as well) They should have an emotionally upbeat/danceable sound, and they need to showcase personality, attitude, and character. They also need to evoke emotion and have a feel-good, positive vibe.\"\n\nPlease submit original, well-crafted Jazz Instrumentals with lots of positive vibes, danceable rhythms, and the type of sound that is reminiscent of \"crooner-era\" Jazz! Your submissions should have jazz-inspired motifs, expressive musical performances, feel-good melodies, swingin' rhythms, and dynamic arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest. Jazz instrumentation that's in the general stylistic wheelhouse of the references will work best for this opportunity, such as brass, strings, piano, upright bass, drums, etc. Live instrumentation is strongly suggested, but if you choose to use virtual instruments or samples, make sure they are high-quality, very realistic-sounding, and appropriate for the genre.\n\nNOTE: You can submit recently recorded Instrumentals in the general style of the reference, OR if you have high-quality vintage recordings (recorded back in the day), they would love to hear those as well!\n\nAll submissions should be roughly 2 to 4 minutes in length (give or take). Non-faded, Buttoned/Stinger endings will work best. Please do NOT copy the referenced material in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, texture, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nNOTE: The sync fees we were quoted were up to $5,000; however, our experience tells us that number is probably based on them licensing Instrumentals from a well-known act through a big publisher like Sony or Universal. We think the sync fees could be lower (in the $2,500 to $3,500 range) for an unknown, independent act or music licensed from a music library. It could go higher – we’re just being cautious and conservative.\n\nThis Publisher offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal. You’ll split any applicable sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Master rights and the Writer’s share, and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher's Share for any placements they generate. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright to submit for this opportunity. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by a TAXI screener that was handpicked by the Music Publisher. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Friday, May 10th, 2024.

Listener discretion is advised.\n\n\"get him back!\" by Olivia Rodrigo\n\n\"MARRY KILL F*CK\" by KennyHoopla & Travis Barker\n\n\"Dilemma\" by Green Day\n\nPlease send them Punk/Power Pop Songs exploding with energy and mainstream radio appeal! Powerful vocals, unforgettable melodies, choruses with a strong hook, and impactful lyrics are all needed for this request. Instrumentation that falls in the general wheelhouse of the references will work best for this request (think electric guitars, drums, bass, etc. all with a modern sound). Any virtual instruments or samples you use should be current-sounding and high-quality. If you have Songs that show off your unique sound and demonstrate how you are bringing something fresh to this genre, send them in!\n\nThis Label has specifically asked to hear at least 2 Songs per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nNOTE: This Label is interested in Artists and Bands that have gained some traction from actively working on their careers. Please detail (in your bio) what you are doing with your career. Include any impressive touring, fan base, sales, streaming, or social media figures. That said – if you’re a new Artist or Band just starting out and don’t have much of a story or track record, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Songs to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for texture and tone.\n\nPlease submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include lyrics, photos, and a bio. All submissions will be screened by a TAXI A&R Team Member who has a strong relationship with the company and great ears.

Your submissions should have timeless melodies, unforgettable hooks, throwback motifs, engaging rhythms, and well-crafted lyrics. Instrumentation in the general wheelhouse of the reference tracks will work best for this opportunity. Please make sure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and genre-appropriate. Compelling, confident, and well-performed vocals are key!\n\nLyric Tip: While not specified, we think that clean lyrics will likely work best for this \"TV/Film sync-oriented\" opportunity. Lyrics that avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity will likely give you an edge, as they're easier to place.\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide to get you in the stylistic ballpark, of the overall texture and tone.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This company has specifically asked that you only send unreleased Songs that aren't already commercially available. If you've already released them on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., or if they’re already published or administered by CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc., please do not submit them.\n\nREALLY IMPORTANT: This company is not just looking for a Song or two from you. They’re looking to build professional, ongoing relationships with artists who are highly committed to working hard, and have the drive and ability to deliver a lot of super-strong material. Having the right type of image and “looking the part” could be icing on the cake, but first and foremost, it's about having great music and a strong work ethic!\n\nThe specific deal points will be handled on a case-by-case basis between you and the Label. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright to submit to this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. Include lyrics, a photo, and a bio. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

DJ Mustard\n\nQuoting the Publisher: \"We are looking for Hardcore Rap songs about drugs, money, sex, and altercations in the style of Dre Dre, Snoop, 50 Cent, DMX, Rick Ross, YG, Jay Z, etc. Songs can range from old school to new in style, and from East Coast to West Coast. Explicit lyrics are okay. Songs with strong production, interesting deliveries, good diction, and catchy choruses that relate to storylines will work in these scenes. Vocals must be confident with a strong production and mix.\"\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Rap/Hip-Hop Songs full of attitude, intensity, and raw energy! Your submissions should have solid arrangements, memorable choruses, and well-crafted lyrics. Instrumentation in the general stylistic wheelhouse of the reference Songs will work best for this opportunity. Please make sure any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality. Confident and well-performed vocals are what this Publisher is looking for!\n\nLyrics need to generally focus on the themes listed above, and profanity is ok for this request! Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Era-appropriate Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nNOTE: The sync fees we were quoted were up to $10,000; however, our experience tells us that this quote is probably based on them licensing a Song from a well-known act through a big publisher like Sony or Universal. We think the sync fees could be lower (in the $2,500 to $5,000 range) for an unknown, independent act or music licensed from a music library. It could go higher – we’re just being cautious and conservative.\n\nThis Publisher offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal. You’ll split any applicable sync fees 50/50. You’ll keep 100% of the Master rights and the Writer’s share, and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher's Share for any placements they generate. You must own or control your Master's and Copyright to submit for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by a TAXI screener that was handpicked by the Music Publisher. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Saturday, May 11th, 2024.

			"request_description": "Lots of '70s-style ADULT CONTEMPORARY SONGS (in a wide range) with FEMALE Vocals are needed by a very successful EXCLUSIVE Music Library. This company has a very long history of lots and lots of really AWESOME placements, tons of which have been for TAXI members!\n\nNOTE: We previously ran this request as TAXI Listing # S240410VS, but the Library wants to hear even MORE material. Maybe they were so impressed with the first batch we sent them, they wanted to get even more? If you submitted to listing # S240410VS, please send different material this time around.\n\nThis Company is looking for a wide range of Mid-to-Up-Tempo Songs that are in the general stylistic ballpark of the following references:\n\n\"Dreams\" by Fleetwood Mac\n\n\"Have You Never Been Mellow\" by Olivia Newton-John\n\n\"Dark Lady\" by Cher\n\n\"It's Too Late\" by Carole King\n\nNOTE: You can submit recently recorded Songs in the general style of the references that capture the authentic sound needed, OR if you have high-quality vintage recordings (recorded back in the day), they would love to hear those as well!\n\nPlease send them a wide range of original Adult Contemporary Songs with female vocals that have a genuine '70s sound and style. Your submissions should include memorable melodies and choruses, solid arrangements, era-appropriate sounds and production, and well-crafted lyrics with a style reminiscent of the '70s. Instrumentation may vary, but it needs to fall in the general ballpark of the references and sound-era-appropriate. Please be sure your vocals are well performed from start to finish, with solid, classic deliveries. The more authentic your Songs sound to the era, the better!\n\nTAXI Tip: A good way to ensure you're on the right path with new renditions of Vintage music is to heavily rely on reference tracks while in the production process! The devil is in the details, and the more you nail in regards to what sounds authentic, the better chance you might have to get this company's attention!\n\nBut, as always: Do NOT copy the referenced artists or songs in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, texture, tone, and overall vibe. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Era-appropriate Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nIMPORTANT! Per our client, your submissions must:\n\n1) NOT be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive) including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc.\n\n2) Be 100% original – no soundalikes, no covers, and no recordings with samples.\n\nThis Company offers an EXCLUSIVE deal, so the material you submit for this request CANNOT be signed with other publishers or catalogs. Sync fees will be split 50/50. The Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share, and you’ll keep 100% of the Writer’s share. You must own or control your Masters and Copyright to pitch for this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

			"request_description": "QUIRKY VOCALESE SONGS (in a wide range of styles) recorded BEFORE the year 2010 with Male or Female vocals are needed by a great Publisher with a long track record of really big placements in a lot of big TV Commercials!\n\nNOTE: This company pays an upfront fee to creators! See below.\n\nNotable: Vocalese is a jazz vocal style that involves singing recognizable lyrics to pre-existing instrumental solos.\n\nDue to the wide-ranging nature of this request, we didn't include references, as we felt they could potentially be more misleading or limiting than helpful.\n\nQUOTING THE COMPANY'S CEO: \"We are looking for quirky, offbeat, odd, and upbeat recordings. We definitely want vocals - particularly vocalese, and songs should have a sense of fun. Songs need to have real instruments (not MIDI), and be recorded before 2010.\"\n\nBroadcast Quality should be era-appropriate. You can submit old masters — or even well-recorded/produced demos — for this request.\n\nPlease submit a wide range of original, quirky Songs recorded before 2010! Your submissions should have a fun sound and creative vocal deliveries such as vocalese, scat, non-sensical lyrics, etc. Light-hearted melodies, emotionally upbeat motifs, engaging rhythms, and solid arrangements are all needed as well. Since this listing is open to a wide range of styles and genres, instrumentation may vary – but please ensure that your submissions contain real instruments, per their request. Well-performed vocals with an \"out-of-the-box\" sound could help get this Company's attention!\n\nMost examples of Vocalese are Mid-to-Uptempo, so stick with that if you'd like to be in the \"safe zone.\"\n\nPlease make sure your Songs were actually recorded before 2010, otherwise this company cannot use them! They DO NOT want material that was recently recorded and made to sound old. They can only use AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL, RECORDINGS, and only if the sound quality is reasonably good. This is a golden opportunity to make money with music you might have thought had no hope in today’s market!\n\nThe Company pays you upfront for the Master Rights and the Publisher’s share of the Copyright. You keep the Writer’s Share and earn income from performance royalties paid by your Performing Rights Organization. This Company often averages several placements per week, and many of those are TAXI members who’ve been signed with them because they submitted to a listing like this! Dozens of TAXI members have signed buyout deals with this company. Several have even received upfront checks for $10,000 to $15,000 (or more!). Deal sizes and buyout amounts vary depending on the quantity and quality of the Songs signed.\n\nYour name needs to be on the Copyright. Your Songs need to be original compositions (no covers), and you need to own or control the Copyright and Master recordings to submit for this pitch. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Monday, May 20th, 2024. TAXI # S240520QQ",

The lyrics express excitement and the sheer fun of creation, describing the inventor’s eccentric habits and the colorful chaos of his inventions.",
				"A track that explores the theme of a vintage circus, where the performers—from clowns to acrobats—are depicted through energetic vocalese and scat singing.

				"The lyrics is about the wild and exhilarating nights spent at a party, where everyone is living in the moment and letting loose, but as the night draws to a close, the revelers must face the reality of life's responsibilities. This juxtaposition captures the essence of déjà vu, as each day resets with high energy only to end in the inevitable return to routine.",
				"The lyrics describe a character who immerses themselves in the nightlife and party scene as a way to escape their monotonous daily life. The track climaxes as the character realizes they are stuck in a repetitive cycle, paralleling the film's theme of repeating days. This realization prompts a reflection on the need for change and breaking free from the cycle, aligning with the movie's narrative.",
				"The lyrics revolve around a festive celebration at a club where the protagonist experiences moments of pure joy and abandon, mirrored by the thrilling beats of the track. However, as the night progresses, lyrics subtly shift to emphasize a sense of sameness and monotony, reflecting the protagonist's limited progress and the looping timeline of their experiences. This shift underlines both the ups and downs of party life and the underlying themes of the movie."

The chorus emphasizes the highs of performing on stage and the adrenaline of the crowd, while the verses reflect on the quiet moments of doubt and the sacrifices made leaving home and family behind. The narrative builds with each verse leading to an empowering finale where the individual triumphs over adversity.",
				"The lyrics describe a comeback story of a once-famous musician rediscovering their passion for music after facing personal and professional setbacks. The beat intensifies as the song progresses, symbolizing the climb back to the top. The bridge offers a poignant reflection on the lessons learned from failure, culminating in a powerful last chorus where the singer celebrates their regained confidence and success.",
				"The song outlines the story of an underdog in a small rodeo town who dreams of becoming a champion despite the skepticism of others. As the rodeo scenes come to life in the music, the lyrics build tension and excitement, mirroring the beat. In a dramatic bridge, the protagonist reflects on the journey, acknowledging the struggles and doubters before a triumphant finale where they achieve their biggest win."

They could discuss a character who once tried to conform to societal norms but has now discovered the power and freedom in embracing their own uniqueness. Catchy phrases and a chorus about dancing to one's own rhythm could highlight the theme of self-acceptance and empowerment, aligning perfectly with the campaign's needs for a song that is empowering yet kid-friendly.",
				"The lyrics could paint a narrative of a young kid who dreams big and refuses to be boxed by traditional roles or expectations. Verses might detail their imaginative adventures and the different roles they play—from astronaut to artist—underscoring the message that you can be anything you want to be. This would not only resonate with the visuals involving a child but also encapsulate the essence of freedom and celebrating one's uniqueness as specified by the client.",
				"The song might focus on a festive scene where everyone is invited to a 'celebration of uniqueness' festival, where characters from various backgrounds come together to showcase their talents and individuality. The lyrics would emphasize themes of unity in diversity and the beauty of being unique, incorporating upbeat and playful music elements, suitably crafted for a tech brand aimed at a broad audience including children."

As the night progresses, however, the song subtly transitions into reflections on how these perfect moments are fleeting, and the coming of dawn brings back reality, emphasizing the importance of living in the now.",
				"Celebration of Now: This song captures the essence of a spontaneous street party that starts from a simple beat someone plays on their mobile phone. The lyrics encourage letting go of worries, dancing like no one is watching, and laughing until it hurts. The twist comes at the end, where the music fades out to the sound of morning traffic, a reminder that the world moves on, and we should cherish these spontaneous joys.",
				"Digital Detox Party: Set against a backdrop of electronic beats, the lyrics narrate a group of friends deciding to put their phones away for a day to enjoy the real world. The song is filled with fun exploits, games, and misadventures, showcasing a carefree and thrilling day of genuine connections. As the song closes, it hints at messages and notifications waiting, symbolizing a return to reality, but reminding listeners of the joy found when we disconnect and dive into life’s immediate pleasures."

Themes and lyrics need to hit on the multitude of emotions felt while trying to process and proceed. They also need to sound current and have been recorded within the last five years or so.\"\n\nPlease submit original Songs in a wide range of styles that deal with loss or grief, and the struggle of working through them. Submissions should be down-tempo and have somber melodies, meaningful choruses, solid arrangements, current-sounding productions, and well-performed vocals. Since this listing is open to a wide range of styles and genres, instrumentation may vary based on which direction you choose to go, as long as it is consistent and competitive with other Songs in your chosen style. Please be sure any virtual sounds or samples you use are high-quality. Modern and well-performed vocals that authentically convey the emotion behind your track and lyrics are needed.\n\nNOTE: They're looking for popular/commercially viable genres that could work with the theme, including (but not limited to): Singer-Songwriter, Pop, Country, Folk, etc. We recommend that you avoid submitting anything in genres that don't naturally work with the theme or the down-tempo requirement.\n\nLyrics should be centrally focused on the theme listed above, and should avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, brands, and profanity as well. Please do NOT copy the referenced artist or song in any way, shape, or form. Use it only as a guide for tempo, texture, and tone. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal, so please be sure the Songs you pitch for this opportunity are NOT already signed with any other Companies or Catalogs. Any sync fees will be split 50/50 with the Company. You'll get 100% of the Writer's share, and the Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher's share. You must own or control your Master and Copyright to submit. Please submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

			"request_description": "EMOTIONALLY UPLIFTING INDIE FOLK SONGS with Male or Female Vocals are needed by a highly successful “TV/Film sync-oriented” Record Label founded by a Big Deal Producer and a team of very successful industry veterans.\n\nThis Label is searching for Mid-to-Up-Tempo Songs that could be found on a playlist with the following references:\n\n\"On The Way\" by Hollow Coves\n\n\"Strawberry Blond\" by Mitski\n\n\"New Love\" by Ziggy Alberts\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Indie Folk Songs with lots of emotionally upbeat energy and positive vibes! Your submissions should have memorable melodies, catchy choruses, uplifting motifs, solid arrangements, and well-crafted lyrics. Indie Folk instrumentation that's in the general stylistic ballpark of the reference Songs will work best (think acoustic guitar, drums, bass, etc). Please make sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are very realistic sounding. Well-performed vocals with an Indie Folk flair are needed.\n\nLyric Tip: While not specified by our client, we think that clean lyrics will likely work best for this \"TV/Film sync-oriented\" opportunity. Lyrics should also avoid references to specific names, dates, times, places, profanity, etc. It makes it easier to get placements in multiple types of scenes and/or TV commercials.\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide to get you in the stylistic ballpark, of the overall texture and tone.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This company has specifically asked that you only send unreleased Songs that aren't already commercially available. If you've already released them on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., or if they’re already published or administered by CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc., please do not submit them.\n\nREALLY IMPORTANT: This company is not just looking for a Song or two from you. They’re looking to build professional, ongoing relationships with artists who are highly committed to working hard, and have the drive and ability to deliver a lot of super strong material. Having the right type of image and “looking the part” could be the icing on the cake, but first and foremost, it's about having great music and a strong work ethic!\n\nThe specific deal points will be handled on a case-by-case basis between you and the Label. You must own or control your Master and Copyright to submit to this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. Include lyrics, a photo, and a bio. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Saturday, May 25th, 2024. TAXI # S240525LK",

This is MUCH more about creating a feeling of peace and serenity, as if the listener is wrapped in a warm blanket and letting go of everything around them. Moods can range from blissful, optimistic, introspective (but not so much as to be depressing), wondrous, tranquil, etc.\n\nWe’re looking for composers who can demonstrate that they understand that the music serves the specific purpose of lulling the listener(s) into a calm, relaxed state. Musical elements, melodies, and/or production styles that show off the composer’s chops will likely take the intended listeners out of their trance-like state, thus defeating the use and purpose of the music.\"\n\nPlease submit minimalist Instrumentals with a relaxing, sleep-inducing vibe and a peaceful, relaxing sound. Your submissions should have one central motif with minimal—to—no—melodic movement, and tranquil, soft sounds. Instrumentation should be ambient and relaxing, such as flowing synth pads, soft piano, muted keys, etc. Please avoid things like bell tree glissandos, triangles, bells, etc., or other elements that could be jarring to tranced-out listeners. Any samples or virtual instruments you use need to be high-quality.\n\nPlease ensure that your submissions remain very SIMPLE, but still maintain a level of artistry and originality. Imagine what you would hear while being hypnotized!\n\nAll submissions should be about 2 to 4 minutes long, give or take. Natural-sounding, faded endings and/or non-faded endings are both okay for this request. Do NOT copy the reference tracks in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe.\n\nPlease submit at least 2 tracks to show your range. If the company likes what they hear, they may contact you about doing a full album!\n\nIMPORTANT: Your Submissions can NOT be commercially released on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., OR be encumbered by ANY other publishing, licensing, administration, and/or exploitation deals (whether non-exclusive or exclusive), including publishing/licensing agreements with CD Baby Pro, TuneCore, etc.\n\nThis company is a Label/Publisher hybrid, and offers an EXCLUSIVE 50/50 deal. Music signed to this deal will be signed exclusively to the company (under a nom de plume), but the composer/artist is non-exclusive and is free to release other material under their own name by themselves or for any other company – just not the same music or the same nom de plume. Please submit as many Instrumentals as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Saturday, May 25th, 2024. TAXI # S240525AM",

You can submit old masters — or even well-recorded/produced demos — for this request.\n\nQUOTING THE LIBRARY: \"We're looking for authentic period jazz recordings. Preferably 1950's but nothing later than 1962. I would prefer smaller jazz combos (Trio, Quartet, Quintet) but that's not mandatory. They should be unobtrusive, relaxed but not sad, and slower to mid-tempo.\n\nPlease submit original Jazz Instrumentals from the 1950s that have a relaxed and easy-going sound! Chilled-out melodies, easy-going motifs, genre-appropriate arrangements, and solid musicianship are all needed here. Jazz instrumentation that's generally consistent with the references and others like it will work best.\n\nIMPORTANT: This company is looking for Instrumentals that were actually recorded during the 1950s, give or take a few years! They DO NOT want material that was recently recorded and made to sound old. They can only use AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL, VINTAGE RECORDINGS, and only if the sound quality is reasonably good. Era-Appropriate Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nThis company offers an EXCLUSIVE, 50/50 deal, so please be sure the Instrumentals you submit for this opportunity are NOT already signed with any other Companies or Catalogs.

			"request_description": "INSPIRING, ORGANIC-Based INSTRUMENTAL CUES are needed by a very successful boutique Music Library that has tons of credits in Big Films, Countless TV Shows, and Commercials!\n\nNOTE: We previously ran this request as TAXI Listing #S240403JR, but the Company didn't find what they were looking for, so they asked us to try again. If you submitted to listing #S240403JR, please submit different material this time around.\n\nVERY Important Note: While no specific genre was mentioned by the company's CEO, if you listen to the examples linked below, you'll quickly understand exactly what he's hunting for!\n\nThis is a catalog you want to be in! Please listen to the following examples the Library's CEO gave us to get yourself in the ballpark of what they need:\n\nInstrumental Examples\n\nQuoting the Company's CEO: \"The beginning should feel intimate and personal – like it's the beginning of a process. Then your arrangement should move forward with more instrumentation to create a sense of making progress. Finally, your pieces should have a positive, inspiring conclusion.\"\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Instrumental Cues full of inspirational and positive undertones! Even though the Library is asking for different sections, they only want Cues that stick to one melodic idea throughout! Create the \"sections\" by layering instrumentation in and out as your tracks progress to create that sense of build and forward momentum. Pay extra close attention to how this is done in the references! Organic-based instrumentation that's in the general stylistic wheelhouse of the references will work best. Please be sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and realistic-sounding.\n\nADVICE DIRECTLY FROM THE LIBRARY'S CEO: \"Many composers throw in way too many ideas and are not focused on ONE CENTRAL MOTIF: they try to keep things interesting by adding new harmonic lines and elements (melodies, even improvisations, etc) instead of focusing on the production and textures. What I'm basically looking for: obvious production music (in form and structure), that sounds like commercial music (production style).\" Put simply, keep it SIMPLE! We know that other Libraries like to receive music with complementary A and B sections, but this Library is NOT one of them – stick with ONE CENTRAL MOTIF per submission, please!\n\nAll submissions should be about 2 minutes long, give or take. Non-faded, buttoned/stinger endings are required. Do NOT copy the references in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, texture, and overall vibe. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nNOTE: This company has a strong preference for composers who understand music licensing companies and how typical music library deals are structured. If that's not you, they politely ask that you don't submit to this request.\n\nThis Music Library offers an EXCLUSIVE deal with a cool twist. You’ll keep 50% of all gross income generated by your music, plus you’ll get 100% of the Writer’s share income generated by your PRO. In other words, if the company licenses your music under a blanket deal, you’ll get income. If they license it for a YouTube video, you’ll get income. Not all music libraries pay you for things like that! The Publisher will get 100% of the Publisher’s share.\n\nBecause this is an Exclusive deal, the music you submit for this pitch cannot already be signed with other Libraries or Publishers. You must own or control 100% of your Master and Copyright. Please send as many Instrumental Cues as you’d like, online or per CD. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

Instrumentation that's in the general stylistic ballpark of the reference Songs will work best (think acoustic guitar, piano, etc.). Please make sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and appropriate for the genre. Genuine, well-performed vocals could help you seal the deal, as well! The bar will be high for this request, so please send your very best!\n\nIMPORTANT: This Label is interested in artists and bands that are actively building their careers. In your bio, please include any touring, fan base, sales, streaming, and social media figures you may have. If you’re an artist or band that’s just starting out and you don’t have much of a story or track record yet, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Songs to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nTAXI Tip: We recommend that you submit at least THREE SONGS per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nYour recording quality need to be clean, clear, well-balanced, and good enough to represent your Songs well. Do NOT copy the references in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tone, texture, and overall vibe.\n\nPlease submit as many Songs as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include lyrics, a photo, and a bio. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI.

Our intentions are to give real feedback, help and advice and offer up our new affordable press campaign..The Down n' Dirty Press Campaign. Having been publicists for bands around the world, we started this small agency in 1998 to work with just unsigned artists and indie record labels. We have seen hundreds of bands blossom and get record deals and publishing deals and festival bookers etc. Most bands have no way of knowing what to do when they want to get their song, band or cd exposure. There is so much noise out there. So much payola. Radio is done digitally now.  National press gets you the validation ( in the form of real press) you need to approach local newspapers,booking agents, festivals, music supervisor, publishers. Its counter-intuitive. When gaining fans you start local and branch out. With press, you start national and then venture in. I would like to help as many musicians as I can with our indie musician press campaign. www.whiplashprandmanagement.com",

Songs about overcoming, fighting through hardships, and dealing with heartbreakNeed songs about overcoming, fighting through hard times, and dealing with heartbreak for a film license.  Songs can have male or female vocals or both.  They should be emotional without being overly dark or depressing.  There should be at least a glimmer of hope somewhere in the lyric. Open to all styles of music.\nIf we think your submission may fit, we will place it on hold for further review by the entire team working on this project.  If it is selected, we will contact you further with details. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a “submission-only” dropbox.  We are looking for the perfect song for this pitch.  We will not be giving detailed feedback on submissions.  Either we feel the song may fit the brief or it doesn’t.  We apologize for not being able to give feedback beyond whether it fits or not, but the time constraints of the nature of these projects will not allow us the time to give in-depth feedback on the song.  We will, however, submit ratings on every submission.- Ric Robbins - President - Incorporated Elements",

WYNNE & Mansionair\n\n\"Wild Things\" by LAUREL\n\n\"Foreign Obstacles\" by Mvlholland\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Indie Electro-Pop Songs with tons of energy, modern productions, and lots of commercial appeal! Your submissions should have catchy melodies, great rhythms, ear-worm hooks, and well-written lyrics. Instrumentation that blends Pop and Electro music and is in the general stylistic ballpark of the reference tracks will work best. Please be sure that any virtual instruments or samples you use are high-quality and not dated-sounding. Confident, well-performed Male or Female vocals are needed!\n\nLyric Tip: While not specified, we think that clean lyrics will likely work best for this \"TV/Film sync-oriented\" opportunity. Avoiding references to specific brands, places, dates, times, and people, etc. is probably a good idea, as well.\n\nYour recording quality needs to be clean, clear, and well-balanced so that it represents your Songs well. Do NOT copy the referenced examples in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide to get you in the stylistic ballpark of the overall texture and tone.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This company has specifically asked that you only send unreleased Songs that aren't already commercially available. If you've already released them on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., or if they’re already published or administered by CD Baby Pro, Tune Core, etc., please do not submit them.\n\nREALLY IMPORTANT: This company is not just looking for a song or two from you. They’re looking to build professional, ongoing relationships with artists who are highly committed to working hard, and have the drive and ability to deliver a lot of super-strong material. Having the right type of image and “looking the part” could be icing on the cake, but first and foremost, it's about having great music and a strong work ethic!\n\nThe specific deal points will be handled on a case-by-case basis between you and the Label. You must own or control your Master and Copyright to submit to this opportunity. Please submit as many Songs as you’d like, online or per CD. Include lyrics, a photo, and a bio. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Sunday, June 2nd, 2024. TAXI # S240602CT",

Your submissions should have slick lyrical flows, memorable hooks, hard-hitting rhythms, funky motifs, and well-crafted lyrics.

			"request_description": "A Wide Range of MODERN INSTRUMENTAL JAZZ ARTISTS or BANDS are needed by a U.K.-based Record Label. They're on the prowl for some exciting acts to sign, and we'd love for you to be one of them!!\n\nNOTEWORTHY: This Label signed a TAXI Member, and they found them through a listing just like this!!!\n\nTake a listen to the references below to get an idea of what might get this amazing Record Label interested:\n\n\"Street Fighter Mas\" by Kamasi Washington\n\n\"Keep On\" by Alfa Mist\n\n\"24th & Lake\" by Terrace Martin & Curly\n\nPlease send in well-crafted Jazz Instrumentals that showcase your one-of-a-kind sound and musical abilities! Your submissions should have excellent musicianship and genre-appropriate arrangements with plenty of forward motion and interest. A cutting-edge, modern sound and style is what this Label is looking for! Jazz instrumentation that's in the general stylistic ballpark of the references will work best. Live instrumentation is strongly recommended, but if you choose to use virtual instruments or samples, please make sure they are high-quality and not dated-sounding.\n\nTAXI Tip: We know that Jazz is a pretty wide-ranging genre. This Company is definitely looking for cool, unique Artists to sign, but your submissions shouldn't be so \"out there\" and/or \"abstract\" that they have zero commercial appeal.\n\nNOTE: This Label is interested in artists and bands that are actively building their careers. In your bio, please include any touring, fan base, sales, streaming, and social media figures you may have. If you’re an artist or band that’s just starting out and you don’t have much of a story or track record yet, but you DO have an amazing sound and some killer Instrumentals to back it up, they still want to hear you!\n\nWe recommend that you submit at least THREE TRACKS per submission so they can see if you’ve got depth in your material.\n\nYour productions and recording quality need to be clean, clear, well-balanced, and good enough to represent your Tracks well. Do NOT copy the references in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a general guide for tempo, tone, texture, and overall vibe.\n\nPlease submit as many Instrumentals as you'd like, online or per CD, and please include a photo and a bio. All submissions will be screened and critiqued by TAXI. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM (PDT) on Monday, June 3rd, 2024. TAXI # S240603ZZ",

			"request_description": "CONTEMPORARY SINGER/SONGWRITER SONGS in a FOREIGN LANGUAGE with Male or Female Vocals are needed by a U.K.-based Music & Media Company that's constantly landing placements in TV Shows, Film, and other Media.\n\nWe purposely avoided putting references in this request as we felt they could be more misleading or limiting than helpful.\n\nSongs can be in languages as wide-ranging as Korean, Swahili, Arabic, Amharic, French, Italian, Spanish, Mandarin, Russian, Hindi, Japanese, etc. Just no English, please! Naturally, more common languages will be more appealing to the client. Obscure languages from lesser-known countries could be less appealing to the Company because there will likely be less demand for those.\n\nPlease submit well-crafted Singer/Songwriter Songs with captivating melodies, well-performed vocals, and plenty of mainstream appeal. Your submissions should have engaging, well-crafted lyrics, memorable choruses, and lots of genuine, emotional energy that could work well for placements in TV and Film. Your arrangements can range from stripped-down productions to more filled-out ideas. Organic, acoustic-based instrumentation like acoustic guitar, piano, ukulele, etc. will suit your submissions best. We highly recommend using real instrumentation, but if you choose to use any virtual sounds or instruments, please be sure they are extremely high-quality and virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\nLyrics should avoid references to specific names, places, dates, times, brands, and profanity. Do NOT submit any material with unauthorized samples of any other artists’ music, sounds, or any other form of media. Broadcast Quality is needed.\n\nQuoting the Company: “Only artists/writers affiliated with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SACEM, IMRO, APRA AMCOS, SOCAN, including all Scandinavian and Latin American PROs, are eligible to submit their music for this opportunity.”\n\nThis company offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE Deal, so you will keep 100% of all Composition and Master Rights.
