	"biography": "Billy Ray Cyrus was born on August 25, 1961, in Flatwoods, Kentucky, to Ron Cyrus, a steelworker who became a politician, and his wife, the former Ruth Ann Casto. Cyrus started singing at the age of four. Growing up he was surrounded by bluegrass and gospel music as his family are musicians. He dropped out of Georgetown during his junior year, realized he wanted to become a musician after attending a Neil Diamond concert, and set a 10-month goal to start a career.\n\nWhile trying to get a recording contract in Los Angeles, Cyrus suffered many hardships including living in his neighbor's car. However, in 1990, he was signed to PolyGram/Mercury. In the same year he opened for Reba McEntire. Cyrus began to record and write music for his debut album, released in 1992. \n\nAlthough Cyrus's song \"We the People\" was used as a campaign song by Republican George W. Bush in his 2000 presidential campaign, Cyrus was reported as saying that he had been a lifelong Democrat.\n",
