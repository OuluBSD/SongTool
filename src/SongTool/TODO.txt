- dynamic size line notes (not 8 lines *8 beats)
- edit beats as full hits or half hits (no first syllables on half hits)

High priority:
- freeze words in rhyme editor and fill blanks
- another prod text, which only takes into account the story
- combine score and order
- color lines + dialogue idea (ready-made) = lyric?
- matching words to colors from - vocabulary: for artist, for release, for song
- what feeling listener should have during release -page
	- re-route it to ideas

Mid priority:
- when opening with task list view, the editor bar is not set
- TxtStructEdit: scroll position of best doc edit is lost

Low priority:
- See all "#include <Database/Database.h>" and change that to use some virtual base class in ToolCore
	- also "#include <SongTool/SongTool.h>"
- TxtStructEdit: feed previous text to prompt when requesting style-comparison completion



Done:
- import existing text to idea
- import attributes from existing text
- rap stylizer tab

	- sustain: what is repeated
	- release: what is slowly forgotten
- colors (several colors per line, up to 8-16)
	- maybe even the color of the lines page/tab
		= text/lyrics as a sound, and ONLY as a sound
- "listener colors"
