- common mask: build from F-M and remove common from F-M
- common snap: build from F-M and remove common from F-M
- fix impact scoring with prompt
- fix pattern mask scoring by calculating weighted
- fix pattern snap scoring by calculating weighted
- visual pipeline before reversing


- visual release: list of ...
	- visual songs: list of ...
	- visual parts: list of ...
- text release. etc.

- edit in COMMON WEIGHTED
	- and VISUAL first

- conversion
	- M-F --> COMMON WEIGHTED
		- find COMMON (match + maybe prompt)
		- calculate WEIGHTED
		- optimize or prompt attributes for WEIGHTED
	- COMMON WEIGHTED --> M-F
		- scoring of M is COMMON minus half of WEIGHTED, F is COMMON plus half of WEIGHTED
		- optimize or prompt M-F attributes from scoring


DONE:
(3.8.2023)
- visual/text context slots in snaps
- WEIGHTED impact
