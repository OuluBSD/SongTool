High priority:
- import existing text to idea
- import attributes from existing text
- rap stylizer tab
	- existing verse (with break): as base, with own content and other artist styles


Mid priority:
- when opening with task list view, the editor bar is not set
- TxtStructEdit: scroll position of best doc edit is lost

Low priority:
- See all "#include <Database/Database.h>" and change that to use some virtual base class in ToolCore
	- also "#include <SongTool/SongTool.h>"
- TxtStructEdit: feed previous text to prompt when requesting style-comparison completion
