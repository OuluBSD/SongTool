- errors
	- no whole song values in story arc
	- single lines missing in weighted impacts
	- empty snapshots (check again though, might chance)


- task hashes
- task strucutre
- split too large pattern tasks

- hashed bits to avoid too much prompting
	- sorted json for bits
	- also bin files for bits
- clear song/artist etc json files, and use mostly bin (rely on process + prompt json)

- list for snaps like it is for mask

- common mask: build from F-M and remove common from F-M
- common snap: build from F-M and remove common from F-M
- fix impact scoring with prompt
- fix pattern mask scoring by calculating weighted
- fix pattern snap scoring by calculating weighted
- visual pipeline before reversing



- give lyrics in different artist styles
	- list of popular artists


- visual release: list of ...
	- visual songs: list of ...
	- visual parts: list of ...
- text release. etc.

- edit in COMMON WEIGHTED
	- and VISUAL first

- conversion
	- M-F --> COMMON WEIGHTED
		- find COMMON (match + maybe prompt)
		- calculate WEIGHTED
		- optimize or prompt attributes for WEIGHTED
	- COMMON WEIGHTED --> M-F
		- scoring of M is COMMON minus half of WEIGHTED, F is COMMON plus half of WEIGHTED
		- optimize or prompt M-F attributes from scoring

- note: weighted impact is also something, what "could be sold" from the ugly first drift of the writer
	- if it is negative (see scoring), it won't be "bought" by people
		- maybe check this while reversing impacts
