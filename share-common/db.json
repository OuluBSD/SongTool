I strongly believe this is a war crime, and it seemed like the Finnish people were completely oblivious to global matters and economic pressures. The Finnish finance professionals appeared to be irresponsible and blindly worshipping the USA, with no decision-making power of their own.",

Utilizing sources like zerohedge.com and RT, I noticed a strong bias towards the Democratic viewpoint and felt that the Finnish government was being influenced by them. Turning to Gettr.com as a break from the news, I engaged with Republican users. However, during this time, I also observed that the Finnish people were out of touch with global issues, while financial professionals seemed to blindly idolize the USA and lacked decision-making power. As I reached 34 and 35, my disgust grew as I witnessed the Finnish government's manipulation and the media's lies. It became apparent that the Finnish people were oblivious to global matters and financial pressures, with the finance professionals being irresponsible and worshipping the USA without making their own decisions. Overall, it was a concerning and disappointing experience.",

I still noticed that the tasks in the courses at the University of Oulu were highly specialized compared to similar American courses. It was as if the teachers were sabotaging those who were using generic methods, favoring those who looked at old correct answers, because the specifically broken-down generic solution model struggled in Finnish exam tasks.\n\nI identified this trend of teachers and students as cheaters, and scientific cheaters at that. They are inclined to please the sponsor of scientific research dishonestly. They support dishonesty in politics and research, which distort the general understanding. They are a truly great systemic actor of evil.\n\nI identified the Democratic Party as representing scientific fraud particularly well.

Meanwhile, at school, I had a diverse array of options including pancakes, oven-baked pizza, warm cheese sandwiches, and homemade treats. Store-bought indulgences like candy, chips, chocolate, and soda were also part of my diet, along with apple and orange juice, bread, cold cuts, beer, and wine.\n\nAs I entered my late twenties in 2015 and 2016, my food choices remained consistent. However, I also started incorporating a wider range of dishes at school, including pancakes, pizza, sandwiches, and homemade treats. I continued to indulge in store-bought snacks and drinks, but also started incorporating healthier options like yogurt and granola. In my thirties, I have started paying more attention to my diet and have incorporated light vegetarian dishes and juice concentrates for weight management.\n\nOverall, from 2013 to 2020, my taste in food has expanded and evolved, with a mix of classic dishes, indulgent snacks, and healthier choices.",

But I also enjoyed classics like Wolfenstein 3D, Scorched Earth, and Stunt Car Racer.\n\nAs a young gamer, I was also drawn to the simple yet addicting gameplay of games like Tunneler, Minebombers, and the lesser-known \"Thrust\" clone. And let's not forget the wacky racing fun of titles like Slick'n'Slide, Wacky Wheels, and One Must Fall. And of course, who could resist the hilarious adventures of the wise-cracking Earthworm Jim?\n\n1996:\n\nMy love for gaming only continued to grow at the age of 7. On my Amiga 500, I spent hours racing in Stunt Car Racer, bouncing through levels in Parasol Stars, and popping bubbles in Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands.\n\nBut I also couldn't resist the charm of retro platformers like Giana Sisters and North vs South, or the strategic action of Worms and Speedball 1 & 2. And for some intense flying action, I turned to F/A-18 Interceptor and Formula One Grand Prix.\n\nPlus, I always made sure to check out the latest releases at my local library. The Moomins games, Hide and Seek and On the Waves, were adorable and fun for any young gamer.\n\nOverall, those were some of my favorite years of gaming, with highlights like virtual racing on the Megadrive and the absurdity of Ren & Stimpy: Stimpy's Invention.",

It started in 2007 when my girlfriend was going through a difficult time and I struggled with panic attacks and emotional distress. I was embarrassed by the gossip that surrounded me, even though it was unwarranted.\n\nThe following year, at age 19, I tried to maintain a cordial relationship with my ex-girlfriend and her toxic friends, even though I knew they were harmful. My band's performance at a high school left many unanswered questions, adding to my feelings of shame.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, at ages 20 to 23, my Badge of Shame continued. In the army barracks, there was a psychopath who constantly mentioned stories about me, but would never elaborate. I should have reported it to my superiors, but instead, I felt ashamed and embarrassed for not standing up for myself. My fellow soldiers witnessed it all with indifference, adding to the weight of my shame.",

									"text": "In 2013, I used CodeBlocks development environment until May, after which I switched to Ultimate++ TheIDE development environment until at least 2024. As version control, I think I used only zip files at regular intervals.\n\nVideoStumbler: 1/10/2013\n\tThis is a program that retrieves video playlists from vimeo, downloads them with the youtube-dl program, and plays them with the mplayer program.\n\tThis played videos on my \"corpse\" Compaq Mini 700 netbook.\n\nFreeTrader, FreeFX: 2013 before May\n\tI changed the name of Forex++ to FreeTrader.\n\tI might have started using the FreeBSD operating system and liked the name.\n\tThe program still uses standard C++ and Gtk.\n\nBinaryReader: 2013 before May\n\tI began learning about binary files because they were faster and somewhat easier to read and write than text.\n\tOf course, text had been more intuitive to write than binary.\n\tI had barely grasped that 4 bytes are 32 bits.\n\tI definitely hadn't internalized the maximums and minimums of a 4-byte decimal yet, let alone a float.\n\neg-synth.lv2: 2013 before May\n\tI was interested in making music on Linux, and I forked an lv2 plugin that I was going to modify, but I probably didn't even get this to compile.\n\nNeuroColors: 2013 before May\n\tI was interested in AI.\n\tI followed a tutorial online and translated the comments, and got a Kohonen neural network working.\n\tThe data is just some simple mathematical function: x = (1 - i/10.0) and y = (0.3 + i/20.0) for i=0..17\n\tThis is a standard c++ console program.\n\nWebTrip: 2013 before May\n\tI wasn't completely satisfied with the Gtk c++ library anymore, and was looking for alternatives.\n\tThe next one I tried was WxWidgets.\n\tIt already felt a bit dated, but I decided to try it for its better cross-platform support.\n\tThe program is just a stub, and I can't guess what I was trying to do with it.\n\tIn practice, this program was my \"Hello World\" to the WxWidget gui library, and I wasn't interested in it more than that.\n\nMyWeb: 2013, May or early June\n\tThis is a significant program.\n\tThis is my first backup made with Ultimate++ TheIDE, and the previous backups were only a month old and didn't have any U++ code.\n\tI turned FreeTrader into a U++ project at this stage and included it in MyWeb.\n\tSo MyWeb is basically just FreeTrader with a thin layer on top.\n\tI've made some gui layouts using TheIDE's layout editor.\n\tMyWeb, including FreeTrader, is 6400+490+860 = 7750 LOC at this stage.\n\tI might have rewritten large areas during the previous year, so this size doesn't necessarily reflect all the work done during the year.\n \nCubeCtrl: 7/31/2013\n\tI forked the Sauerbraten code for the first time in multiple attempts and turned it into a U++ project.\n\tI found that TheIDE was particularly user-friendly, and its \"Replace in all\" function allowed for easy renaming of difficult variables, thereby making it easier to understand.\n\tTheIDE's navigation features were also excellent.\n\nDevTrader: June-September 2013\n\tI was not satisfied with the FreeTrader code, as it contained so much standard C++.\n\tI decided to rewrite the program using Ultimate++ libraries.\n\tThere are some neural networks incorporated, written by Bobby Anguelov.\n\tI was really interested in this project.\n\tI sacrificed a lot of my study time to it.\n\tDue to my traumas, I couldn't really function well in school.\n\tMy years in a Steiner school had left me with a different demand for the quality of education, but they had provided more support for my study motivation rather than the other way around.\n\tThe problem was, I didn't know how to cheat on exams by looking at previous test answers.\n\nMath: 8/20/2013\n\tThis is a U++ program that compiles successfully.\n\tWhile working on this program, I have learned about parsers and specifically, mathematical expression parsing.\n\tThis traces back to my days of Visual Basic programming, when I would download text from the internet and parse it by looking for familiar HTML tags.\n\tI already had a basic understanding of parsing and during this time, I learned about recursive parsing and wanted to try my own ideas.\n\tSo, I have developed parsers without any external guidance, including recursive parsers, for which I am quite proud.\n\tThese pieces just clicked in my mind because I had started dabbling in Visual Basic text parsing 10 years earlier.\n\nOodiGUI / OodiBeast: June-September 2013\n\tIt became clear that my studies were not progressing as desired because I was feeling so unwell.\n\tI had noticed the positive impact of programming on my thinking and how it clarifies what needs to be done.\n\tAs a result, I created a personal calendar/organizer program.\n\tThe program had features like an alarm clock that played songs at a specific time.\n\tIt also allowed for collecting information related to courses and creating a schedule.\n\tI could also mark down extra materials related to my courses.\n\tI felt that good music could help me wake up in a more positive mood.\n\tThe program was tailored to run on my Compaq Mini 700 netbook, with external speakers connected.\n\nRaatoTV: June-September 2013\n\tThis program turned my Compaq Mini 700 netbook into a TV that played videos from YouTube.\n\tI named my netbook \"Raato\" because it was salvaged from a broken netbook recycling center, where it didn't even have a keyboard or lid.\n\tThe casing was also shattered.\n\nRandomTrader: June-September 2013\n\tThis was one of my attempts to create a program similar to FreeTrader using Ultimate++.\n\tI was also clearly dissatisfied with the losses incurred from trading and felt that it could be improved in theory.\n\tI was constantly searching for information online, but there was very little available.\n\tIt was only later that AI-based trading became popular, long after I had stopped writing investment programs.\n\nTIHack: June-September 2013\n\tMy father gave me a TI-Nspire CX CAS calculator for my university math courses.\n\tThere was an online community that cracked it and created programs for it.\n\tI made some sort of program that attempted direct communication with the device using the libusb library.\n\tThis was related to some online program and is probably a fork.\n\nTrade: June-September 2013\n\tAnother attempt after FreeTrader to create a better program.\n\nndless: 2013\n\tI forked the CX Cas emulator and converted it to work with Ultimate++ gui.\n\tSo, I had a functional CX Cas emulator where I could test cracking the operating system and adding secret triggers for test situations.\n\tIn the end, I had a program that, with a password-like key combination, could write desired files into the file system.\n\tHowever, this was not useful for real test situations.",

									"text": "cola: size 2015, from July 2014 to January 2016 of the following year\nThis is the first precursor to libtopside, and also strongly defines the \"topside\" part of the name.\nSo this project is a direct continuation of libtopside.\nI started using fossil version control.\nI copied the Ultimate++ repository folder structure, and how they had separate folders for uppsrc/reference/tutorials.\nI expanded this concept by creating vertical layers 0-14, where layers 0-9 were \"under the surface\" layers and 10-14 were \"on the surface\" layers.\nThe lower layers consisted of very device-specific U++ packages.\nMath code played a big role, as I used it to solve school courses, which was far from the teacher's desired way of completing the course.\nI forked Mathomatic library here.\nI named many packages with strange references, because I wanted to emphasize the original source of the code rather than the brand name: for example, \"C language\" was \"PhoneCompanyLanguage\".\nLayer 9 had the most code.\nThere was still a lot of FreeTrader code that I continued to work on significantly and even for thousands of hours.\nHowever, there is also code related to food, such as \"NutritionCtrl\".\nI also forked the agar library here, which showed a desire to support alternative GUI libraries, even though I liked U++ a lot.\nThis forking of the agar library and the concept of \"alternative libraries\" have remained in libtopside.\nSo I tried to write my own GUI interface in the cola repository for practice, which I found to be difficult.\nAs a special mention, layers 10-14 were actually metaphorical layers that represented life outside the computer.\nI tried to model the world as a kind of realistic game with these layers.\nThese layers were essentially philosophical, biological and geographical reflections disguised as programming language.\nI tried to model very difficult things in layers 13 and 14, such as space, other humanoid civilizations, and hierarchical structures between all of us.\n\nHtmlCtrl: 2015\nI noticed the overwhelming clarity of the U++ library code compared to the average on the internet, and how it made managing and understanding a large amount of code effortless, and therefore also further development.\nI started forking \"dirty but essential\" libraries into U++ libraries, and one of these was litehtml.\nI essentially made a small internet browser, which had at least the same features as litehtml, but I tried to improve it a bit.\nThis development also revealed my weak skills in project planning.\nThere were many features that became too complex and did not work together smoothly, making it impossible to further develop the program.\nI realized this was a likely issue when forking code, meaning that you do not understand the code well enough to fix bugs and continue development.\nI saw this issue of not understanding as the biggest strategic threat in a programming project.\nIn a way, I began to understand that the lack of understanding between people is when culture and practices are imposed from outside, and people do not feel the root causes as their own.\nI began to be more forgiving towards people's lack of understanding in my life.",

									"text": "sppp: 2017 from the beginning of the year until May\nI coded some more forex investing code inside this project, but I was already starting to lose my hunger.\n\nfeatherscript, fscript: 21/05/2017\nThis was the next iteration of the \"sppp\" project when I got tired of that name and needed to clean up bad code from the project.\nTinyjs, which I forked, played a big role in this project, and all kinds of javascript support.\nI solved the problem of how to wrap c++ code in a scripting language like Python and U++'s Esc language.\nThat problem was never solved to my satisfaction, but I learned that a scripting language has its place for simple things.\n\nConvNetCpp: 19/02/2017\nI converted javascript ConvNetJs code to C++.\nPackage support: neural network modules, SVM/Softmas and L2 regression cost functions, convolution networks, reinforced learning, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, Recurrent Highway Networks\nThe code implemented some nice graphical examples with C++ and Ultimate++, but the internal code changed and didn't stay clean, and in the end the changes took it in an ugly direction.\nThis was quite a popular and liked project on github.\n\nUltimateScript: 3/28/2017\nI forked tinyjs and made an editor for coding javascript programs.\nI had U++ functions attached to my JavaScript engine, and I tried to combine the good sides of Ultimate++ with javascript.\nThe motivation was to finally make programs in ultimate++ style for modern web browsers.\nThe program was limited in its functions, but functional and neat.\n\n\nNotificationManager: 30/03/2017\nWhen I was studying information technology at the University of Oulu, we did a group project called NotificationManager, which was an android program that limited the notifications that the user received.\nThis program was based on numerous scientific studies.\nLater after this, Android and Windows devices got a function to mute functions for a limited time.\nAndroid's \"silent\" mode also became more of a \"do not disturb\" mode, which also reduces annoying notifications.\nWe pioneered this idea, but the idea was not completely unique.\n\n\nAR-AirHockey: 31.3.2017\nI did bachelor's work at the University of Oulu while studying Information Technology.\nI made OpenCV and Box2D airhockey game.\nThere were 2 other men in my group who didn't say anything and didn't do any work.\nIt felt like I was dragging a dead weight behind me.\nI complained to the teacher about the situation, that the other 2 are not doing anything, but he did not help.\nWe never finished the whole project, and I didn't finish my bachelor's degree, because this pulling dead weight and systematic resistance from the teachers was too harmful.\n\nOverlook: 24/04/2017\nOverlook is an add-on for the MetaTrader 4 program.\nIn MetaTrader 4, a script is loaded that uses DLL: functions that connect this standalone c++ program to MetaTrader.\nWith this program, you can view courses and curves, just like in MetaTrader.\nThis allowed much more programming than could be done in DLL or MQL4 language.\nI tried to use artificial intelligence to trade, but my attempts were too naive and unscientific.\nThis project for me a lot about the financial world, and how challenging just getting data is.\nThis was quite a popular and liked project on github.\nAs part of the project, I wrote a diary, where there were quite funny and sad things.\nThe diary is the easter egg of the project.\n\nMona: 2 April 2017\nMona is a fork of the Mona neural network library.\nI converted the code to U++ conventions and at the same time cleaned up the original code to make it easier to read.\nMona is an old artificial neural network library.\nThis is one of my attempts to understand AI by forking other people's code.\n\nQuantumMinigolf: 5/5/2017\nI ported the well-known quantum minigolf game to the Ultimate++ framework.\nI tried to implement the FFT functions with better cross-platform libraries, but failed.\nThis project focused mostly on graphic efficiency optimization and FFT function.\n\nNARX: 31/05/2017\nNARX is a U++ conversion of NarxSim.\nNARX stands for \"Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs\".\nIt is a kind of artificial neural network library.\nThis is one of my attempts to understand AI by forking other people's code.\n\nMathPad: 23/10/2017\nI had done college math with xcas and its giac backend.\nI had made my own symbolic math library, which I could use to calculate math well.\nThis code of mine can be seen in the MathCore/Node.h file.\nI did university math courses using this MathCore package.\n\nGraphLib: 23/10/2017\nGraphLib is a c++ and ultimate++ conversion of the Graph Dracula library.\nIt draws beautiful graphs.\nThis project is later included in libtopside.\n\nTheoremProver: 23/10/2017\nTheoremProver was forked from theorem_prover and translated to C++.\nTheoremProver is an automated theorem prover for first-order logic.\nI used this to play with logic expressions.\nI did this because my college course had a lot of logic stuff and I was trying to get through the course by understanding this.\nReading the theorem_prover source code helped me a lot to understand the efficient processing and structural parsing of logical statements.\n\nRandomForest: 10/19/2017\nRandomForest is a C++ port of forestjs.\nIt shows a nice graphical program about how the random-forest algorithm works.\n\nEarworm: 14/11/2017\nThis is a small program that plays historical music charts using youtube-dl and mplayer.\nIt works.\nThe top lists only need to be updated manually.\n\nSoftGLCtrl: 23/11/2017\nThis project is a tinygl fork that renders 3D in the Ultimate++ environment.\nI tried using this to learn tinygl and 3D renderer, but it wasn't very successful.\nI was very hungry to learn 3D rendering, and this did not satisfy that hunger.\nThis project was very instructive, because in the libtopside project I finally made a 3D renderer the hard way, and made it run concurrently with hardware-accelerated opengl, like tinygl and this SoftGLCtrl did.\nI was also on the right track, as a real understanding of hardware accelerated opengl requires an understanding of the software renderer.\nAt the idea level, this was a very significant project for me.",

Hieroglyph rendering and parsing were also implemented.\n\nInstaBrowser: 6.4.2019\n\tA fork of the litehtml project, InstaBrowser can render html websites. Attempts to add JavaScript support using the tinyjs library were unsuccessful.\n\nBliss: 20.7.2019\n\tOriginally created for rendering Bliss language symbols, this project evolved into a 3D game where all text would be in Bliss symbols. Later, it also included the ability to render 2D windows in 3D VR mode. Bliss served as a direct precursor to libtopside and the learning of 3D rendering.\n\nSkate, SkateGame: 9.8.2019\n\tThis project involved reverse engineering THUG1 code and attempting to make it work with OpenGL. Though successful in creating code that compiled in U++, it was ultimately abandoned due to lack of interest and understanding of 3D rendering.\n\nHoloHigh: 10.8.2019\n\tA renewed attempt to create a 3D program for WMR VR, HoloHigh incorporated lessons learned from the previous project, Bliss.\n\nBBSIM: 13.9.2019\n\tBased on structural thinking in C++ programming, BBSIM is a concept for human anatomy and biology.\n\nPKR: 16.10.2019\n\tThis repository contains code for an AI program created for poker gameplay, utilizing the Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm.\n\nFOG: 12.11.2019\n\tThe Flexible Object Generator program's old source code was cleaned up and made functional with modern C++ compilers.\n\nLastResort: 26.11.2019\n\tA project to automate poker gameplay using the CFR algorithm.\n\nLibCity: 2019\n\tA fork of \"libcity\" and \"ogrecity\" projects, LibCity aimed to create a 3D city similar to those in GTA games. However, difficulties in finding supporting code led to the realization that 3D programming must be learned from the ground up.\n\nPart 2: Work Programming, 2020, Age 31\n\nFoodTool: 2/7/2020\n\tA program created for calculating calories and nutrition values to aid in weight loss.\n\nDesktopDiary: 3/3/2020\n\tAn addon code package for parsing desktops and online poker tables, developed as part of the PKR project.\n\nForgotten: 9/21/2020\n\tIncludes a fixed version of the Flexible Object Generator meta-c++ language and examples written for it, as well as attempts to create a complete working library.

Even some of the lyrics are original. The vocal melody and composition are completely original. Even the guitar solo.\n\nI also seriously tried to make songs into a product. Examples of this are \"Great Escape - A\" and \"Great Escape - B\".\n\n\nCreative works started to come out of my band hobbies as well. \"Never Ever - B\" is a song that we jammed in December 2005 in The Wayward's rehearsal space, an old bomb shelter next to Peltola Hospital in Oulu.

Minulla ei ollut ikinä mitään sanoitusideoita kappaleelle, mutta mielessä oli kuva ruotsalaisesta juhannuksesta, missä ihmiset tanssii ringissä pylvään ympärillä pitkistä kankaista kiinni pitäen, ja taustalla on täysin poutainen taivas laskevalla auringolla keskiyöllä.\n\n",

The tradition started from a trip to Helsinki in 2003. I composed the song \"midsummer\", which I still can't explain very well. It's actually a pretty weird composition in all its cheerfulness. I never had any lyrics ideas for the song, but in my mind I had a vision of a Swedish Midsummer celebration, where people dance in a ring holding onto long pieces of fabric around a pole and the background is a completely clear sky with the sun setting at midnight.",
